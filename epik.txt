Best Place to Sell Domains : Epik Marketplace	29-Mar-20	"A domain name is your unique address online. The uniqueness of these addresses makes them valuable. There is one and only one Google.com, Facebook.com, Epik.com ..etc. You cannot have two or more companies using the same domain name and hence if you desire to own a domain name that is already taken, you have to buy it from the current owner! This has led to the creation of a massive aftermarket industry for domain names. Now whether you want tobuy a domainor you want to sell one, you will need an intermediary who can take care of things like domain ownership transfer, fund transfer ..etc. Finding the best place to sell domains is the real challenge! In Domain Industry these places are often referred to as Marketplaces and finding the best place to sell domains is the real challenge!How to find the best place to sell domains?Now there are many marketplaces that exist for domain name buying and selling but there are some key features that one must take into consideration while choosing which one to go with.Here is a list of some of those :Safe and Hassle-free Domain transferWhether you are buying or selling the domain name, you would want to have an easy method to transfer a domain name and also verify that you have legitimately transferred it (as a Seller). A domain name is always registered with some registrar and hence a registrar is in the best position to know whether the seller has initiated a transfer or not.Quick Payment Deposit & TransferAs a Buyer, you would want the marketplace to have various possible methods of depositing money and as a seller, you would want to have various options for a quick withdrawal. There are some marketplaces that restrict people from certain countries to deal and also some of them use way too slow fund transfer processes which can sometimes take 15 days. One needs to be careful while dealing with such marketplaces.Reputed and TrustworthyWhen you are dealing with domain names, you must check the reputation of the Marketplace. There are many examples of scammers trying to defraud buyers by selling names that they don’t own.Flexible Payment OptionsPremium domains priced at 5 to 6 figures USD can sometimes be a lot for an entrepreneur just starting up. Hence instead of investing the entire amount upfront, the buyer must get a choice of easy payment plans. Sometimes the Buyer may want to simplylease domain. This is good for testing waters as to whether or not the purchase would be profitable for him. He can then decide to buy it later at a certain price.Epik – The Best Place to Sell DomainsTaking into consideration the above points there are only a few Marketplaces that stand out and obviously,Epik Marketplaceis the best place to sell domains.Epik is a domain name Registrar and Marketplace that has been into the business for a long time and is considered as 1st choice for most of the industry top leaders.

"Domain Leasing : How we do it at Epik, and how you can too!"	27-Mar-20	"At the Webfest conference in Los Angeles, one of the recurring themes that I encountered was the topic ofDomain Name Leasingas alternative monetization strategy for domain holders.  At Epik we have long believed in the power of leasing domains and have some transactional experience and operating competency in this area.  Domain Leasing was Epik’s 3rd largest source of revenue in Q4 2012.  We could not be more enthusiastic about the future of Domain Leasing.Why Domain Leasing?Simply put, New Economic Realities requires New Economic Models.  More businesses are being bootstrapped and financed with less available at-risk capital.  As a result, the margin for error is smaller.  The majority of prospective domain buyers view a 4, 5 or 6 figure domain purchase as a material decision. Leasing is a way to reduce risk, and leave more startup capital to fund operations while still building on a superior domain name.In our experience, most customers who do lease a domain, eventually buy the domain.  It is purely a question of cash flow planning.  While discounting is one option, we prefer to lease. One the big challenges of domain leasing is managing the cost-benefit equation.  For most Domain Owners, a $10/month leasing transaction is not worth the trouble.   However, when that process is fully automated, the cost-benefit become compelling.  Automating and streamlining the leasing process is exactly what we have done at Epik. And it is definitely working.How we do it at EpikAt Epik, all of our leases are managed through theEpik Marketplace. Customers come to a landing page for a domain name or website listing.  Most listings have a purchase price, but can optionally have a leasing price.As a general guide, we tend to set leasing at 1.1% of the purchase price with a minimum amount of $10.  That being said, there is no rule that says that lower or higher numbers will not work.  For example, a parked domain with established or traffic or revenue should command a higher lease price.Visitors to theEpik Marketplacecan select their preferred currency.  If the customer chooses Leasing, they are walked through a checkout process which sets up repeat billing during the leasing term.  The domain owner (Lessor) is notified of their transaction and the new leasing customer  (Lessee) receives an email confirmation of their lease.Once the lease is completed, the domain is managed in the Epik account of the Lessee, while the Lessor retains registrar ownership. Epik manages the rebilling, with100%of the leasing proceeds deposited into the Lessor’s account. If the Lessee fails to make a Lease payment, the Lease is terminatedSome Illustrative Case StudiesReaders of this blog love case studies.  Here are a few recent leasing examples that illustrate the model. They are just a few examples taken from Epik’s owned and operated portfolio for recently completed leases.Carpool.com– a larger transaction:  The client leased this domain for $20,000 per quarter. As part of the leasing agreement, they also secured the right to purchase the domain for a multi-six figure $ purchase price. After leasing the domain for 2 quarters in 2012, the lessee elected to exercise the purchase option and is now the owner of this premium domain name as of January 2013.  During the leasing period, Epik provided registrar support.WalkNTalk.com– an upsell made possible by leasing:  After receiving an unsolicited inquiry about this domain, we contacted someone with a similar domain to gauge their interest in making a competing offer.  It turns out that the contact wanted the domain badly but could not meet the $6500 list price.  As a result, they leased the domain for $65/month and now have an active option to purchase the domain for $6500 which they intend to do later this year.eCannabis.com– a simple lease to own transaction:A buyer visited the Epik marketplace and made an unsolicited lease of the domain at $65/month.  They now have the ongoing purchase option at $6500. Depending on the changes in cannabis legislation in the US, this option could well turn out to have been a brilliant move by the leasing customer who secured the option.In addition, we do many leases in the $10-30 range per month.  While this is not much, these leases now make considerably more than they did parking, and amply cover their holding costs. In the meantime, the lessees are in most cases adding value to the domains via development.  And again, most domain leases do end in domain sales, particularly leases priced at greater than $30 per month.  The higher the leasing price, the greater the skin in the game for the Lessee.Why Epik?Epik is not the first company to invent leasing of domains.  However, we are among the first companies to create and managea domain leasing platform that actually works. In addition, we believe we are thefirst to integrate domain leasing with a real-time registrar escrowthat protects all parties in the leasing transaction.–Automated Lease Management:  When Epik integrated registrar management starting in 2011, we also significantly increased our development capacity for adding new functionality.  Following some early success in leasing, we set about to develop a leasing process that could scale, automating whatever processes could be automated while at all times protecting the interests of all stakeholders in the leasing transaction.  Leasing is literally as easy as Parking.–Leasing platform protects both the lessor and lessee:  Epik is the neutral third party that sits between the Lessor and Lessee. During the Lease period, the Lessor cannot transfer or sell the domain/website to another party.   Similar the Lessee can onlyusethe domain but cannot see or change the WHOIS or authorization code. As a result, even privacy-protected domains can be leased on Epik.–Integrated Reporting of Stats in the Marketplace:  A leasing customer may be interested in knowing the current site statistics.  To make this painless and transparent, our marketplace displays statistics that are updated daily.  Parking data is automatically retrieved from popular parking services like Voodoo, DomainPower, Rook and Bodis.  We plan to add more as these companies expose their customer performance data via API (Helloooo Frank Schilling).–Ongoing support for Lessee:  During the lease period, Epik provides full service customer support to the lessee.  Post-transaction, the domain owner is not bothered with ongoing requests for using the domain name, e.g. changing DNS, setting host records, or activated hosting services or cloud services like Google Apps, etc..  This makes leasing scalable, even for smaller transaction amounts.–Commission free and even Tax free Transactions:  Epik operates the only Domain Marketplace in the industry where customers can sell or lease domains commission-free and even tax-free.  How do we do it?  Ourpatent-pendingprocess allows domain sales to be settled in “Masterbucks”.  Use your sale or leasing proceeds to register, renew or transfer domains, or any other service that Epik offers. Alternatively, you can simply cash out — there is a 5% cash out fee to cover payment processing costs. Either way, it is an unbeatable offer from Epik.Leasing Domains and Websites on EpikDomain Leasing on Epik is easy.To protect the interests of Lessor and Lessee, we require that the domain is registered at Epik.  For those who are not aware, Epik is an ICANN accredited registrar now serving more than 50,000 customers.  We are a full service registrar, largely serving end users.  For professional domain investors, we offer very competitive pricing, with $8.34 for transfers for everyone, and with renewals as low as $8.03 for .COM.

The Future of Domain Name Brokers and The Long Tail by Rob Monster	20-Feb-20	"You have probably heard the termDomain Brokerbut perhaps you don’t have clear understanding of what they do?As per the definitionadomain brokeris a person who buys and sellsdomainnames for others. There are numerous misconceptions about what adomainbrokeractually does. … Domains are not lottery tickets, they are a commodity meant to be traded for a profit.Here is an in-depth post about “Future of domain broker and the long tail” by our own Rob Monster CEO of Epik.com.We are confident that you enjoy the article and it will benefits each of you more.Future of Domain Broker and the Long Tail by Rob Monster,Some of you will be familiar with the term “The Long Tail”. It is perhaps one of the most famous articles ever written in Wired Magazine back in its hey-day. Chris Anderson is the visionary author. The old classic can be found here:https://www.wired.com/2004/10/tail/What exactly do I mean by “Long Tail” DomainsThere is a finite but knowable universe of people who will value the domain name TampaGolfLessons.com. If you can find them and engage them good chance that they value them for some price that allows them to earn a return from switching from what they use now to something better.To illustrate, these are classic: “long tail” domains:The Barrier to entry to become a Domain Broker is effectively zeroWhy I think it matters to domainers is this: the super-brokers might not have any interest in brokering a 3 figure domain or a 4 figure domain because of the size of the prize is too low, even at a 20% commission. Some brokers won’t even take on a domain for less than 6 figures, again due to the small size of the prize.On the other hand, in some parts of the world, notably in emerging markets, many people have more time and intellect, than they have money or domains. Nevertheless, they absolutely do have much to offer the domain industry by using their time and talent to connect supply with demand.As we look ahead to the next phase of domaining, I foresee anexplosionof Domain Name Brokers. The long-time brokers might perhaps dreading this day because they will up against a dual squeeze:1. Godaddy, the aspiring monopolist, now has 1 million owned and operated domain names that they will be eager to sell through their channel to a vast retail customer base with a brokerage team who will be under pressure to add value and have access to a large proprietary data set about who buys what domains.2. Emerging markets are about to serve up an absolute explosion of independent NameBrokers, who can make use of a fast-expanding array of free tools for finding who owns what domains, and can use secure ways to clear those transactions, e.g. through marketplaces and escrow services.So what is a Boostrapping Domain Broker to do?The good news is that brokering domains is a capital-efficient way for emerging market participants to bootstrap their way into an industry, even with little or no capital.One way to get started is to leverage a service like NameLiquidate.com – go find a domain that isnewlylisted, and try to find a buyer for that domain before the reverse auction ends. After all, the price keeps comingdownwhile your prospective buyers can be bidup.Many people might look at NameLiquidate on the last day, looking for expiring auctions to find the bargains. However, the contrarian move is a bit different and that is to look at the new arrivals, and not just for the mispriced domains but I think more importantly for the bootstrapper, the arbitrage opportunities.Examples:We plan to add an “Escrow” feature right inside of NameLiquidate.com so that domain flippers can essentially send a domain into escrow, cover the transfer fee, and then have a short window to make good on their purchase. If they fail to make good, the auction resumes and the broker is out their transfer fee.Looking ahead, the Epik team does have larger ideas for how to a fast-expanding pool of domain brokers could leverage a NameBrokers.com platform — we acquired the domain last year. Will share more on that if folks are interested in the topic.Why a massive increase in the number of brokers is good news for (almost) everyoneThe really great news for domain owners is that there will be a vast supply of highly energetic people who will be able to help connect supply with demand and to get more supply into the hands of end-users. The end result of this is more liquidity in the domain economy and higher retail prices for quality inventory.We love your feedback and encourage you to engage with Rob Monster here onNamepros.comFollow Rob Monster onLinkedinFollow Rob Monster onTwitter"
Domaining : A Beginner’s Guide for 2020	10-Jan-20	"You might have heard the worddomain. What aboutdomaining? If you are entirely new to this, I will start with a brief explanation of the termdomain.Adomainname is an address used to identify a website.It can have extensions like .com,.net,.org and several others based on geography, profession, ethnicity and more. There are 1514 top-level domains(TLDs) as of January 08, 2020 (source:ICANN).A domain name can be registered for a fee on a yearly basis through a domain registrar likeEpik.Now let’s have a look atdomaining. Domaining is the process of buying and selling domain names. It’s a speculative business for those people with an intention toshoot the moon. It’s a business that requires a lot of patience to become successful. Even though people say that all the good domain names are already registered, you can still find good ones if you spend time in that.There are two ways by which you can build a good domain portfolio:Register good domain names that are available.Buy good domain names from others.The first option requires only the registration cost, which is normally affordable. But for the second option, you will need to invest more in order to get good domain names. So if you are low in budget, go for the first one else the second.Here are some important tips to remember as a new domainer:1.Do not start investing before you learn domaining. The selection of domains is very important whether to register or to buy. This will save you a lot of money. As a beginner, you should spend some time around domainer forums likeNameprosto learn the strategy. There you can learn a lot from veteran domainers.2.It’s also recommended to do research usingNamebio, where you can search for the sales data for a particular keyword and extension. The number in sales indicates the popularity of that particular keyword/niche.3.You can useEstibot, a free domain appraisal tool, to find the estimated value of a domain. Even though it’s not a complete method to evaluate the worth of a domain, as a beginner you can use this tool to get an idea of the domain value before you make any decision.4.For registering new names, it’s recommended to use a domain registrar likeEpik.com. Epik also offers you the facility for bulk searching, where you can put up to 500 names at a time and search. If you have a registered account, then you can even request support to increase this limit. Also,if the names are available, you can purchase them immediately without any hassle. If you find a domain you are interested in is already registered, you can backorder it. Backordering is a service that attempts to register a domain name for you when it’s available for registration.5.If you plan to buy valuable domains from other domainers, you can do so by using services likeEpik Marketplace, Flippa or Namepros Forum.6.Check for valuable expired domains every day and catch them before they drop. For this, you can make use of theEpik Daily Diamondssection in the Epik Marketplace.7.Acquiring domains is not the only process in domaining. You should inform the world that they are for sale or lease. The recommended method is to build an SSL landing page for your domain using Epik. You can also list them at a popular marketplace like Epik Marketplace.8.For beginners, it’s recommended to invest in the most popular extension.comsince it has a very high probability of getting sold. When you become experienced, you can move on to other extensions.Do not spend a lot of time researching. After acquiring some knowledge, you can start buying/registering domains. For the ones you think have more value, you can keep them for a long time. You should also register/buy domains for quick selling and make a profit. This is the best way to learn domaining. The motto should beBUY-SELL-LEARN. The more you do this, the more you learn and will become better and better in domaining."

Domainer Friendly Resources	26-Dec-19	"Domaining is one of the most lucrative industries I know out there. Folks have made millions of dollars by selling domain names. The person who buys and sells domain names is called a domainer. If you are a domainer or you just want to start your domaining career as a domainer, you would need some resource which helps you to shine your skills. The tools which I am going to tell are some domain tools that are helping domainer a lot or at least very helpful to decide on a domain name.1.Finding an Expired Domain NameEvery domainer knows that every best domain name which has potential value got registered a long time ago, but there are still ways to get some of them. The way to find potentially expired or about to expiry name is a tough process but thanks to following domainer friendly tools which help us to find the one with ease.ExpiredDomainsUsing ExpiredDomains.net, you can gather all the information about a potential domain name which is about to expire or dropped. It will let you know everything about that domain name. You can check the Alexa rank and count backlinks as well and can see when the name was first registered.Expireddomains.net also lets you know about domain names that are in the auction or available for purchase in an aftermarket likeEpik, Godaddy auction or Sedo. It’s a free service, and I believe it’s one of the best domainer helpful resources available currently.FreshDropFreshDrop.com is another domainer tool which helps you to find sellable about to drop or expired domain names.DomCopDomCop.com is another excellent tool that is very useful for hunting a good domain name. Domcop has lots of features that will tell you the potential of the domain name. Domcop uses metrics fromAhrefs,Semrush, as well as plenty of other top-notch tools, and that’s why it’s a paid tool but worthy of every penny.2. Drop Catching Tools for a DomainerNow, after finding a good domain name that is about to drop and you want to catch it before anyone else, then you need to use drop catching services/tools, which are called Domain Drop Catching Tools. Many tools help you to catch the domain name by paying a fee. It varies where some of them charge a lot and some low.Epik Drop CatchingEpik.com is one of the most reputed domain registrars. Epik offers full-fledged domain registration services and provides everything that a domainer needs including domain name registration, escrow, domain lander, domain marketplace, and domain drop catching services for the lowest cost.

They collaborate with Namejet.com, and Namejet now is part of NetworkSolutions, which is the world’s first domain registrar. It costs around $79 to backorder a dropping name.DropCatchAs the name itself suggests what sort of the tool it is, I don’t think I need to tell you that it’s another drop catching tool that every domainer is using. The chances of catching dropping names throughDropCatch.comare always high as it uses the network of domain registrar which Dropcatch owns. It’s around 700+ domain registrars. The standard backorder rate at DropCatch is $59. It goes to the private auction if there is more than one person trying to catch a domain name.3.

Epik draws line on Acceptable Use	6-Aug-19	"Seattle, WA— [August 6, 2019]— Global Domain Name Registrar and Internet Technology Provider,EpikInc., provided an update regarding itsBitMitigateservice as well as its decision to not provide site hosting services to the controversial message board service known as 8Chan.Chronology of key eventsOn Sunday, August 4, 2019, Internet Service Provider, CloudFlare, announced that it was terminating its services to the popular alternative message board service, 8Chan, without opportunity for appeal. The following morning, on August 5, 2019, a principal of 8Chan contacted Epik, Inc. to request its consideration for a transfer-in of accounts and necessary technical services due to Epik’s previously declared stance on lawful free speech. Although 8Chan domains were transferred to Epik early that Monday, Epik remained reticent in the interim to provide a definitive statement regarding the prospect of providing content delivery services to 8Chan; namely, for Denial of Service protection or Content Delivery Network services through its operating division called BitMitigate. In the course of Monday, in response to 8Chan’s social media statement of its anticipated deployment of content delivery services with Epik, a critical network provider of so-called Border Gateway Protocol services elected to discontinue services for Epik with immediate effect. Although Epik’s core domain registrar services were not impacted, Epik’s BitMitigate service was rendered temporarily inoperable due to interruption of contracted upstream services.BitMitigateservices restoredAlthough the disruption of services by upstream providers did have the potential to be highly damaging to BitMitigate’s customers, Epik engineers worked diligently to restore services to its customers. The BitMitigate platform is designed to provide highly scalable and cost-effective solutions for Content Delivery and Denial of Service mitigation. The system has successfully defended against so-called Layer 7 attacks as well as attacks involving more than 1 million unique IP addresses in a single coordinated attack. The Content Delivery Service provides intelligent optimization for fast loading of web content, most notably on mobile devices. The BitMitigate service has been integrated into Epik’s flagship product calledResilient Domains.Statement on Acceptable UseEpik actively supports lawful content, community, and commerce. As a matter of policy, management seeks to provide customers with solutions without bias or favoritism vis-à-vis race, religion, political affiliation, or sexual orientation. If a given content is legal, Epik endeavors to empower anyone to participate whether as producer or consumer. With the prevalence of user-generated content, including in fast-growing public forums, timely enforcement of Terms of Service can prove extremely difficult, notably in cases where a site has little in the way of revenue model with which to fund the services of professional moderators. In cases whereby Epik identifies a particular publisher as being under-equipped to properly enforce its own Terms of Service, Epik reserves the right to deny service.Statement on decision to not provide BitMitigate service to 8ChanUpon careful consideration of the recent operating history of 8Chan, and in the wake of tragic news in El Paso and Dayton over the weekend, Epik has elected to not provide content delivery services to 8Chan. This is largely due to the concern of inadequate enforcement and the elevated possibility of violent radicalization on the platform.About Epik Holdings Inc:Founded in 2009, Epik is a leading full-service, all-inclusive domain name registrar, as well as the leading provider of domain name leasing services and provider of transactions services for domain name and website assets. Domain industry regulator, ICANN, has accredited the privately-held provider of domain registrations since 2011. In 2019, Epik also acquired BitMitigate.com and high-availability hosting provider, Sibyl Systems LTD.About Rob Monster:Entrepreneur of the Year, TEDx alumnus, author, venture investor, and philanthropist, Rob Monster, is a global advocate for digital sovereignty and empowerment, believing in the tremendous untapped potential for the Internet to improve quality of life through digital solutions for content, community and commerce.

Epik announces acquisition of BitMitigate.com	14-Feb-19	"Epik.com is pleased to announce the completion of the acquisition ofBitMitigate.com,an integrated solution provider for Content Delivery Networks, Denial of Service protection, DNS resiliency and Virtual Private Networks (VPN).What is BitMitigate?Founded in 2017, BitMitigate has developed a comprehensive suite of tools for protecting websites from malicious traffic while also improving performance through a proprietary Content Delivery Network and Web Application Firewall. The result is higher uptime, faster websites, greater scalability, increased resiliency and a dramatic reduction in vulnerability to malware. As of February 2019, BitMitigate processes more than 400 million requests per month. Epik began cooperation with BitMitigate in 2018 through the development of a variety of advanced services for preserving digital security and privacy atAnonymize.com, including a quantum-resistant VPN, DNS Resolver, private web search and web proxy.A Timely Deal adds Mission Critical TechnologyIn the wake of rising censorship and organized efforts to de-platform and incapacitate practitioners of lawful free speech, there is a growing need for effective counter-measures. Thehigh profile defense of Gab.comas a registrar client was also a wake-up call to the fragile nature of the digital value chain that allows online brands to operate on the public internet. Arbitrary takedowns by domain registries, domain registrars, web hosts and DNS providers all collectively represent vulnerabilities resulting in not only active censorship but also self-censorship by publishers who may feel compelled to actively remove lawful content, as well as actively cancel the user privileges of lawfully-engaged content contributors.BitMitigate is a nimble innovator in a market dominated by one company: CloudFlareThe brand BitMitigate will continue as a wholly owned division of Epik Holdings, Inc. The sector that BitMitigate competes is currently dominated by CloudFlare, a company that protects a reported 10 million websites and which is expected to go public in 2019 at an expected valuation of $3.5 billion. Although CloudFlare has carefully navigated the Free Speech issue, their upcoming IPO is expected to create new expectations from institutional investors that may cause them to reconsider their willingness to provide services to some customers, or adjust pricing in response to investor demand for increased financial performance.Nicholas Lim joins Epik as Chief Technology OfficerBitMitigate founder Nicholas Lim will continue as President of BitMitigate. He will also join Epik Holdings as Chief Technology Officer and co-architect of the fast-maturing Epik technology ecosystem. Rob Monster, Founder and CEO of Epik.com explained the appointment, “Nick Lim is a very rare talent. He combines a profound capacity for full-stack software development with a rare zeal for making the work better while connecting the dots to turn vision into reality. I look forward to partnering with him to realize a shared commitment to making the Internet work better.”"
Is Censorship and De-Platforming of Domains moving upstream to the registry level?	18-Nov-18	"Domain industry bloggerDomainIncite broke a story on November 16that revealed efforts by theWerte Initiativein Germany to compel ICANN to initiate a takedown request for a website. The notion of a takedown request directed to the CEO of ICANN is perhaps not novel. However, in the wake of the coordinated takedown of Gab.com in the exact same week as this letter was apparently transmitted is worth of note by the domain industry.By way of orientation, here is the original letter dated 10/23/18:The site in question does not seem to have incitement to violence but rather catalogs information about various individuals and organizations.  The content itself looks like “Free Speech”, a topic which is generating considerable controversy in the Digital Age. Whether or not ICANN advised the complainant informally, we now know that the formal response came nearly 3 weeks later, on November 13, from Göran Marby, CEO of ICANN:What can we take away from this very current correspondence?There is apparently a continuing, coordinated and perhaps accelerating theme of censorship that extends beyond content that is of a potentially threatening nature as has been alleged in the context of Gab.  Moreover, this effort is now global, not just the U.S., and it includes active lobbying of ICANN for takedown of specific domains.For now, ICANN is continuing to hold the position that they are not adjudicating about acceptable use of domains but are instead continuing to defer to registries and registrars as governed by their Terms of Service or as they may sovereignly rule by exception should they wish to do so.The website referenced in Werte’s letter remains online pending decisions from registry operator (Donuts), and registrar NameCheap (now part of Tucows) as to whether to comply with the take-down request. Given the recent November 13 response date from ICANN, we could expect to see governance action as soon as next week.In the meantime, where does this recent news leave registrants in terms of reasonable expectations for Due Process?  Well, we have some very recent case history for both Registries and Registrars.Key Lesson #1:Registriescan banish a domain without Due ProcessOn October 15, 2018, the domain nameIncels.mewas set to the inoperable state of Server Hold by the.ME registry, the country code TLD of Montenegro.  The operators of the site reported in apress releasethat this happened without warning and also that there the registrant was not given an opportunity to cure. This effectively means that anyone who buys a .ME from now on should put an asterisk next to their domain to footnote the risk that while they own the domain, it can be arbitrarily taken out of use as and when the registry chooses to do so.  This also adds registrar counter-party risk as the .ME registry does not explicitly require that a .ME registrant enter into an Acceptable Use agreement with the registry as part of the checkout process.  By contrast, when any registrant purchases an ICANN-governed domain, they are required to explicitly accept the ICANN terms, such as you can see in this example for a .COM:Looking ahead, it remains to be seen whether Donuts takes action, particularly if they are pressed sufficiently either by lobbying groups or by social media. From my reading, the case for a takedown seems weak given the absence of incitement to violence on this particular website as was alleged in the case of Gab. For such a weak case as this one, I would expect that a takedown action by Donuts would cause widespread action by registrants to steer clear of Donuts registries on a going forward basis, just as theprice increases of up to 3000% in March 2017 by Uniregistryraised important questions about whether Uniregistry has sufficient governance in place to protect stakeholder rights.Key Lesson #2:Registrarscan banish a domain without Due ProcessWhether or not the registrar, in this case, Tucows, takes action on this domain name remains to be seen. As of today, just a few days after the ICANN letter, the site is up.  However, we know from thehigh profile takedown of Gab.com by Godaddycovered intensively by the media, that registrars can sovereignly take down any domain without warning, and can do so without giving the registrant an opportunity to cure as was the case with Gab. Epik is very familiar with this case having taken the position that Gab.com should have been eligible for Due Process, and opted to step in as registrar, as explained in thisimportant blog post on why Epik accepted Gab.com.  In addition to stating Epik’s position through the blog, Epik also took the ratherunusual step of indeed setting an expectationamong the Gab user with regards to ongoing self-governance as a precondition for sustainable use of Free Speech.The Future of the Domain Name Industry is being determinednow!Whether or not there is a viable domain industry 10-20 years from now, or whether it is supplanted by an alternate addressing system is being determined by the actions the industry takesnow. In the specific case ofGab.com, a $300,000 domain was being held in escrow on behalf of a registrant while Gab made payments on a domain. The de-platforming action taken by Godaddy on October 29 placed a high value domain at risk of permanent impairment, leaving the domain in limbo, registered in the name of the escrow agent.  At the time of the take-down action, there were 4 counter-parties with claims on the domain:  (1) the registrant, (2) the user of the domain who was making payments, (3) the escrow agent, and (4) the registrar.  Talk about a messy takedown with collateral damage!For now, I applaud ICANN for deflecting this latest request for censorship without Due Process. The drumbeat is getting louder for a global framework for governance and adjudication, similar to the UDRP process administered byWIPO. For adjudication of takedown requests, I believe the “high court” will need to be comprised of personselectedthrough a transparent democratic process rather than staffing the judiciary with appointees. GivenICANN’s ample $454 million in funds under management, it is not unreasonable to think that ICANN could easily fund a salaried high court comprised of democratically elected persons responsible for establishing and managing a global judiciary for governing takedown requests. This would protect registries and registrars from being crucified by public opinion for simply doing their jobs!In the meantime, Registries and Registrars that choose to play fast and loose with Intellectual Property Rights can expect to see brand damage as individuals, organizations, and business owners begin to amplify a counterbalancing message relating to the impact of unilateral takedown operations. In the absence of incontrovertible demonstration of bad faith  (e.g. blatant phishing operations where time-sensitive action may be imperative), it is reasonable for any domain registrant to expect (1) appropriate due process, (2) reasonable opportunity to remediate, and (3) orderly transition planning to another registrar in the event of continuing non-compliance with Terms of Service."
Why Epik welcomed Gab.com	3-Nov-18	"The domain Gab.com has landed at Epik.This post will summarize whyEpikwelcomed Gab.com. It will also address why I believe the operators of the site have the right to be online.De-Platforming is Digital Censorship. Blacklisting is Digital Shunning.“I have always strenuously supported the right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.”– Thomas Paine (1737-1809)For those not familiar with the case, Gab.com’s ability to operate was abruptly terminated by Godaddy, among other vendors, who deemed Gab to have violated their terms of service. Thisde-platformingof Gab generated much discussion in the mainstream technology press. It also prompted a lively discussion in the professional domain name community, including at the popular discussion boardNamePros.As the news broke, and as some elements in the mainstream media rendered their judgement, I embarked on my own search for truth. Along the way, I did have an opportunity to meet with the Founder of Gab, Andrew Torba, an entrepreneur who was willing to swim against the tide for what he believes is right, namely empowering netizens to discuss openly about matters of mutual interest with limited risk of censorship.Although, I did not take the decision lightly to accept this domain registration, I look forward to partnering with a young, and once brash, CEO who is courageously doing something that looks useful. As I reflect on my own journey as a truth-seeking tech entrepreneur, I have no doubt that Andrew will continue to develop not only as tech entrepreneur but also as a responsible steward — one that can balance bravado with diplomacy and who tempers courage with humility.A Word on Inalienable RightsDe-platforming a haven of free speech is not about left or right. Anyone who remembers studying civics is familiar with the concept of inalienable rights — rights that a worthy government can only protect but would have no moral authority to take away. The idea of Natural Law and Inalienable Rights dates back to Ancient Greece, if not before. Tolerance for competing views — including those protected by Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Press — is not an American concept even though the Founding Fathers of the United States built a prosperous nation around the concept.We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.– Thomas JeffersonThese days there are many kinds of online content that some people find objectionable. When it comes to publishing content, online or offline, there is an interplay between free will and personal responsibility. Specific to Gab, the decision to not onlytoleratebut towelcomecompeting views, does come with a responsibility to take action when free will is exhibited without personal responsibility. This was famously illustrated in the opinion rendered by Supreme Court in Watt vs. United States (1969) where threats of violence was deemed unlawful.In the case of Gab.com, there is a duty to monitor and lightly curate, keeping content within the bounds of the law. The duty is perhaps best explained by Uncle Ben of Spiderman fame:“A Republic,if you can keep it.”– Ben Franklin (1787)A Word on Decentralization of OwnershipOne of the unique features of Gab is their democratic approach to capitalization. For an online media portal with exponential growth, there are variety of potential acquirers and investors that would have a keen interest in providing growth capital, even for a business model that is presently loss-making as is the case with Gab. Rather than go down Sand Hill Road, they have opted to follow in the footsteps of Blockchain by designing a distributed ownership model. And while Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) lost some of their heady momentum, the premise of shared ownership for shared outcomes remains compelling.In the domain name world, we often talk about domain ownership. The reality is that we are mostly leasing domains from registries, who in turn is often regulated by a regulator ICANN. Recently I have been a vocal advocate forForever domain registrationswhereby a domain is free of ongoing expense. At the moment, this is possible through Epik though there is still more work to do to make this a risk-free industry norm. The danger of not proactively embracing digital sovereignty, in all its forms, is that the digital world will inevitably find a way to achieve it, with or without domain names.Let Freedom RingTo the casual observer, the case of Gab.com seems like it is something new. It is not. It is history repeating itself. While there are consequences to actions, there is also the proverbial risk of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. My hope, for all of our sakes, is that Gab.com treads wisely, using its liberty for the betterment ofmost, and the enlightenment ofall.‘Those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.– George Santayana (1863-1952)Sincerely,Robert W.

Global Domain Industry heralds arrival of Perpetual Domain Registrations	24-Oct-18	"An important milestone on the road to Digital SovereigntySeattle, WA and Barcelona — [October 24, 2018] —During the 63rdconvocation of global domain industry regulator, ICANN in Barcelona, perpetual domain ownership achieved an important milestone as Seattle-based Epik.com became the first domain name registrar to offer perpetual domain registrations for hundreds of popular domain extensions. Since the advent of private ownership of internet domain names, owners of domains have become accustomed to annual domain name renewal along with regular price increases for ownership of domains. From time to time, over the years, important domain names have unintentionally fallen into the wrong hands or have become temporarily disabled due to expiration or policy enforcement.Although perpetual registrations are not yet available for every domain extension, a growing number of popular domain extensions can now be secured perpetually for a one-time fee. For example, the iconic .COM can be secured at Epik.com for the one-time, all-inclusive fee of $420 regardless of where a domain is presently registered. Eligibleforever registrationsat Epik include free privacy protection, theft protection, forwarding services and unlimited subdomains all at no additional cost.Epik.com Founder and CEO, Rob Monster, a digital rights advocate, is a member of the ICANN global registrar stakeholder group that convened in Barcelona this week. In an interview on the opening day of the ICANN conference, Mr. Monster explained the move, “This is an important development for the domain industry. Customers have been asking for perpetual domain registrations for years. Epik is working with industry stakeholders to make forever registrations not only available but also affordable and eventually commonplace for registrants around the world.”Peace of Mind in the Digital Age. Forever.Forever domain registrationsprovide individuals and businesses with peace of mind.  Once a Forever registration is secured, the future risk of domain loss due to administrative oversight or lack of funds is eliminated. While domain owners are still subject to legal use, domains can now become an enduring part of a will or estate, with continued managed registration compliance, even after the death of the original registrant. A Forever domain registration, which can be optionally combined with a Forever hosting plan, offers not only peace of mind, but also allows registrants to preserve their digital legacy, and on their terms.Forever Registrations are for EveryoneDomain names are often described as a form of digital land. Freehold property ownership is not without precedent. Freehold ownership dates back thousands of years where the practice of perpetual land ownership was the standard. Epik is the first ICANN-accredited registrar to offer the perpetual registration. Additional registrars are expected to follow in the coming year. In the short time since Epik began offering Forever domain registrations, more than 1000 Forever registrations have been completed.Epik customer, the Father Flanagan League has purchased 43 Forever registrations.   League President, Steve Wolf explained the value of the Forever registrations, “Our mission and agenda is an enduring one. Epik has been a trusted and unwavering ally in securing our digital presence for the long term.  With a portfolio of managed forever registrations from Epik, our digital presence is secured permanently and this is one major aspect of our organizational identity that we do not have to constantly deal with.  This Epik service feature is a tremendous value and gives us peace of mind.”Debra McCann, mother of international music sensation Kiesza, also secured Forever domain registrations for the Kiesza and SteamPop brands. “With Kiesza’s global chart topping hits, brand protection was a priority. We secured Forever registrations from Epik. Whether Kiesza is in the recoding studio or on world tour, we sleep well at night knowing that Kiesza’s most important domains can never fall into the wrong hands. Our domains are right where they belong. Forever.”Paulo Leocadio, of Pompano Beach, Florida is Founder of SculpIT. Paulo owns 23 Forever registrations at Epik, broadly protecting the SculpIT brand across multiple planned categories of factory. He explains “The name ‘Sculpit’ means different things to different people. I am protecting my brand across multiple new domain extensions including .FITNESS, .LIFE, .DIET.  Forever registrations are a key pillar in protecting my brand once and for all.”Jim Reifsnyder-Smith, of A1B 2BC is the owner of the premium 3 letter domain with an appraised value of more than $1 million that he leases to another Epik customer on Epik.com. Jim bought a Forever registration at Epik and explains “We lease our domain, so perpetual ownership gives our lessee’s extra peace of mind knowing that the domain they have been leasing isn’t going anywhere.”For further information, or to schedule an interview, contact Rob Monster, CEO of Epik, atrob@epik.comor at +1(425)-765-0077.

2018 Year-end tax planning for owners of Domain Names and Websites	24-Oct-18	"For many people, the year 2018 has been a good financial year.  As we are now in the fourth quarter, I wanted to take a few moments to share some pro tips for using your domain holdings to manage your year-end tax liability.Forever DomainsOne of the most popular moves for reducing your 2018 tax liability is ourForever domain registration. This is a one-time purchase of aforever domain.  This service is uniquely offered through Epik and can be done with most domains.  The Forever domain allows you to recognize a 2018 expense to cover the registration costs for as long as you hold the domain at Epik. To check if your domains are eligible for Forever registration, visithere. In addition to Forever domains, Epik also offersForever web and email hosting plans.Year-end domain sellingOne of the unique features of Epik is that we are not only a registrar but also a domain name marketplace for selling and leasing domains.  When you sell domains on Epik, your proceeds are initially deposited tax-free in a Masterbucks account.  These proceeds can be held or spent tax-free. If you are redeeming your proceeds, that is generally considered a taxable event and possibly best timed for after the new year. If you are new to selling and leasing domains, read our helpful how-to guidehere.  For transactions larger than $10,000 use ourescrow service.Fund your account for planned 2019 purchasesYou may also fund your Epik account through your preferred payment method before December 31, 2018.  Your deposited funds are held in the form of Epik In-store Account Credit which can be used for future domain and hosting related expenses regardless of whether you choose to process the renewals at this time or after the new year.  You can fund your account online from your account by logging in and adding fundshere.Domain Gifting and Estate PlanningIf you hold domain names that have appreciated in value, you may gift domain names to qualifying institutions such as 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations. To do this, you will want a 3rd party appraisal of the domain names being gifted, particularly if the size of the gift is more than $5,000. If you have a domain portfolio that would logically benefit a qualifying institution, that institution can in turn use or sell those domains.  For a professional appraisal,visit our appraisal page here.CryptocurrenciesFor anyone holding cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Epik does offer the option of funding your Epik account using these cryptocurrencies in addition to bank deposit, wire transfer, ACH, and PayPal.

Why I stood up to Legitscript	24-Apr-17	"A client of Epik recently pointed out to me that I have apparently annoyed the people at Legitscript. They referenced this post that appears on the Legitscript blog:https://www.legitscript.com/blog/2017/03/us-registrar-epik-plays-dangerous-game/Since their attorneys will likely advise them to take it down quickly, I kept a copy should anyone need to see it later on.Up until today, I had not even noticed their blog post. Now, having seen it, as I am not so easily bullied or intimidated, I herewith post an open letter to both Legiscript and to their sponsors.To start, here is the full text of my ICANN complaint response:My official response to ICANN’s complaint from Legitscript – Case ARO-840-05646:Hello,Further to your Notice, I am getting back to you with our findings.Per your request, I am attaching the full transcript of the correspondence with Mr. Horton of Legitscript related to the domain names in question. This conversation is logged in our online support ticketing system and was handled by a staff member, Matheus Leite.In the meantime, in the wake of this escalation to ICANN, I have evaluated the content of Mr Horton’s claims. We believe there is sufficient debate on the standing of Legitscript to warrant taking a light hand when it comes to the disposition of the sovereign property of registrants. While we certainly would never condone distribution of “fake pills”, we have no way of adjudicating whether or not the identified domains are in fact engaged in such a practice. Unlike child pornography, where the assessment is obvious and enforcement is swift, online pharmacies require professional evaluation by a competent expert.As for whether or not Legitscript is competent, a cursory review of the history of the Legitscript entity reveals ample evidence that the group is a proxy for US pharmacy interests, and that they use heavy-handed influence tactics without regard to due process through a court of law where the registrant’s case can be tried and the evidence examined by competent persons who are subject to providing due process. Here is one of many examples:https://www.pharmacycheckerblog.com…s-by-john-horton-president-of-legitscript-comAs a matter of policy, Epik does not host any of these sites. The domains in question are owned by 4 registrants, none of which are affiliated with Epik in any way other than as customers of the registrar. These registrants do receive WDRP notices per the RAA although they use a 3rd party privacy proxy.As for RAA compliance, we are confident that we are in full compliance of 3.18 of the 2013 RAA:3.18.1 Registrar shall maintain an abuse contact to receive reports of abuse involving Registered Names sponsored by Registrar, including reports of Illegal Activity. Registrar shall publish an email address to receive such reports on the home page of Registrar’s website (or in another standardized place that may be designated by ICANN from time to time). Registrar shall take reasonable and prompt steps to investigate and respond appropriately to any reports of abuse.3.18.2 Registrar shall establish and maintain a dedicated abuse point of contact, including a dedicated email address and telephone number that is monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to receive reports of Illegal Activity by law enforcement, consumer protection, quasi-governmental or other similar authorities designated from time to time by the national or territorial government of the jurisdiction in which the Registrar is established or maintains a physical office. Well-founded reports of Illegal Activity submitted to these contacts must be reviewed within 24 hours by an individual who is empowered by Registrar to take necessary and appropriate actions in response to the report. In responding to any such reports, Registrar will not be required to take any action in contravention of applicable law.3.18.3 Registrar shall publish on its website a description of its procedures for the receipt, handling, and tracking of abuse reports. Registrar shall document its receipt of and response to all such reports. Registrar shall maintain the records related to such reports for the shorter of two (2) years or the longest period permitted by applicable law, and during such period, shall provide such records to ICANN upon reasonable notice.As you can see from the attached correspondence, the complainant received a prompt reply.There is ample evidence in this case, and from observations from similar cases, that Legitscript wishes to serve as jury and executioner without being subject to due process.As we are not in a position to adjudicate whether or not any of the 4 registrants are engaged in an illegal activity, we have referred the complainant to the court system which can adjudicate in these matters.In the meantime, after reviewing the list of alleged abuse domains, we have taken the domain myxanaxpills.com offline as this domain trespasses on a registered trademark, and is a violation of Epik’s published terms of service. To secure the domain, the TM holder (not the complainant) should pursue UDRP, arbitration or court order.We will be happy to promptly respond to any and all correspondence from ICANN on this matter. In the event of an adjudicated outcome from a recognized court we will be happy to comply with any takedown request.In the meantime, we ask ICANN to kindly request the complainant to secure a judgement in a competent court.Regards,RobThe case was closed by ICANN on March 21, 2017.Now, let me address the blog commentary.(1) I do genuinely care about people’s wellbeing. My wife is a physician with a successful medical clinic,Naturomedica.com, on the eastside of Seattle. I am also an avid student of health issues and am generally vigilant to matters of personal health. I am rarely sick, avoid vaccines, and rarely take a pill other than nutritional supplements from reputable sources.(2) I have no way to gauge who is involved in selling genuine therapeutics and who is not. The supplement industry has the same issue where there is much in the way of supplements sold with questionable efficacy. I imagine that businesses that engage in such, will not be in business for long. Caveat emptor.(3) We are a registrar for relatively few of these types of domains. As far as I know, we don’t host pharmacy sites. As such, this is not about money. It is actually about principles. In particular, it is about due process.(4) My issue with Legitscript is that they are more than likely serving as a proxy for big pharma They are routinely engaging in bullying tactics, moral suasion and false presumption of guilt.To be clear, I do genuinely believe that the world does need a qualified global procedure for prosecuting fake pills. Last month I met with the executive team of the World Chambers Federation and ICC International Court of Arbitration, albeit this was forDigitalTown.com, the other company I lead as CEO. Since WIPO does not adjudicate decisions on fake pills, perhaps another entity should. That entity should be competent to test for efficacy of therapeutic claims and also be competent for evaluating whether a branded good is in fact an imposter.In the meantime, here is what I advise to domain industry stakeholders:(1) Encourage the ICA to show backbone. Yes, Phil Corwin, this means you. I do love your work, but you need to guide the stakeholders in achieving due process.(2) Invite and encourage the registrar industry to fight fire with fire. May truth and due process prevail. Registrars have a duty to protect legal registrants. It comes with the job.(3) When the class action starts for Legiscript, please contact me. I have put them on notice that I object to their false accusation and public presumption of guilt without due process. They are unaccountable thugs.And I close with a thank you to ICANN for serving as stewards of the industry. While your ongoing interrogatories can at times drive me up the wall, I believe you did get this one right. See you in Madrid for GDD Summit."
"Why DigitalTown bought 10,000+ .CITY domains – and why it matters"	13-Jun-16	"Over the last couple of weeks, more than 10,000 .CITY domains were registered by a single registrant calledDigitalTown.comat Epik registrar. This is actually the other major company besides Epik where I serve as CEO. As DigitalTown does have some relevance to the domain industry, in this post I will outline what DigitalTown is doing.What is DigitalTownDigitalTown is a public Company (OTC: DGTW). I joined DigitalTown as CEO in May 2015, initially as a turnaround CEO but since signed on for longer. DigitalTown is building a global smart city platform. If you are not familiar with the term “Smart City”, you will be seeing a lot more of that term in the future. Technologies like Uber and AirBnb are beginning to exemplify some of the early characteristics of a smart city.  While these niche applications are compelling solutions to specific problems, they are just scratching the surface.Looking ahead, a genuine Smart City will make transacting locally a seamless and frictionless experience, whether it is with a local merchant or whether it is with the local government. To this end, the DigitalTown platform is designed from the ground up to be operated in collaboration with local civic leaders as stakeholders, partners and even administrators.  The DigitalTown platform relies heavily on smart phone applications but also embraces the future of a “Smart Web” that will be more intuitive and easy to use.Why build on .CITY domainsThe focus of DigitalTown is to empower thriving local economies, typically organized around cities as the local governing entity that has both resources and personnel who are empowered to guide the local economy towards greater well-being of the community.  Each city will typically have its own character and “brand” identity. For many cities, this brand has never been formally defined by city management. Yet, nevertheless, each city through the process of time is developing a brand as a result of the personalities, businesses, competencies, and public services that are associated with that city or town.  As such, it also follows that a city website should reside on its own branded domain. The .CITY TLD, operated by Donuts, is a perfect domain extension for hosting multi-stakeholder city sites. DigitalTown’s mission is to now bring these .CITY domains and the DigitalTown cloud-hosted content management platform to the cities that can use these city brands effectively.  As for why not build on .TOWN, because towns often become cities, whereas cities very rarely become towns.The need for Architecture and Design in the new Smart WebAs many registry operators are aware, one of the topics that I have been spending a great deal of time on in recent months, is navigating the topic of how the new domain extensions could be become part of an intuitive navigation framework for a “Smart Web”.  In response, a number of registries have embraced this notion of a strategic approach, aligning with DigitalTown in a formal way.  For example, DigitalTown will roll out a network of approximately 30,000 .MENU sites this year to power a network of local restaurant directories, as well as power a .MENU branded solution for online restaurant management. In the process, we expect .MENU has a compelling opportunity to emerge as ade factostandard for direct navigation in local communities for dining information.  Other registries have taken a more tactical approach, e.g. making blocks of domains available in bulk for development.  However, all registries with whom I have spoken agree with the fundamental premise that the web needs to become more intuitive. It needs to become Smart.   To this end, DigitalTown will be championing a network of “Short cuts” or “Life hacks” that will allow consumers that use web browsers in order to directly navigate to exactly what they are seeking.The importance of Single Sign-OnThe concept of Single Sign-on for the web is certainly not a new one.  I first began working on Single Sign-on solutions back in 2007 through a project called Federated Identity, concurrent with a vast rollout of a network of sites called Product Portals.  The premise of single sign-on is as valid now as it was then, i.e. the need for portable identity and portable reputation for being able to effectively navigate across a federated network of sites so that users do not need to register each time at some niche website. DigitalTown is working to provide a flexible framework that can power a secure online wallet, that is tied to the personal smart phone.Will DigitalTown be Global?DigitalTown is a global platform.  The Board of DigitalTown is committed to the vision of enabling participants to “See the World through Local Eyes”. Although the test markets for DigitalTown (Sibley County, MN and Leavenworth, WA) have been in the US, DigitalTown will establish regional presence in strategic hubs around the world, starting with Dubai later this year following a recent strategic investment by a Qatar-based industrialist.  While .CITY –and english language keyword TLDs in general — may not be ideal for every market, English remains the shared language of most of the developed world and will likely remain such for the foreseeable future.  That being said, the user interfaces can and will be localized. Moreover, real-time translation technology for text-based messaging has matured to the point that it becomes highly practical to connect persons of different nationalities, languages, cultures and religions in real-time.DigitalTown is a shared vision for the Future of the WebThe near-term outlook for domain investors is mixed.  In fact, if stakeholders in the domain economy are not proactive, a large portion of domain economy is at risk of being supplanted by search engines (Google, etc), niche sites (e.g. AirBNB, Expedia, Tripadvisor in the travel category), and by a fast growing universe of clever and secure mobile applications.  In retrospect, I believe ICANN did the domain economy a very great disservice in handing out registries to private operators who in almost all cases had no TLD-specific business plan that would (1) make that TLD useful to end-users, and (2) make the internet as a whole more powerful.  Nevertheless, these domains are now in private hands. Those private stakeholders now have an opportunity to be intelligent stewards.  As such, I invite registries and registrants to be thinking about how to become aligned around a shared architecture that begins to make the web Smart.  This is no different than a group of landowners, agreeing to conventions on area codes, postal codes and street numbering. The result is faster development with less chaos.A word about Epik to Domain InvestorsEpik was never built to be the biggest registrar. Rather it was built to be the best, as well as to participate in the governance dialog related to the future of domains.  Over the coming year, you will see accelerated innovation coming from Epik, including the introduction of mobile services and support for resellers who wish to take advantage of our advance domain name management platform using their own brand identity. We view domain investors as stakeholders and partners in the curation of the Internet. And while DigitalTown did take out many .CITY domains in the last couple of weeks, there are still some fantastic deals to be had in the .CITY registry  Pricing through Epik is as low as $3.50 for the first year.  Contact Epik Support for more information about how to get partner pricing for .CITY domains."

Impressions from ICANN 51	16-Oct-14	"Greetings from Los Angeles where I have spent the last few days at theICANN 51conference. While much of the content is the stuff of policy wonks, I found it time well spent. As the CEO of an ICANN-accredited registrar, I believe it is important to be active in the dialog around the future of the naming system and to develop direct relationships with the stakeholders and decision-makers from around the world.  I greatly appreciate that ICANN hosts these meetings.The US Government is all-in with ICANN — but does that really matter?The headline event of ICANN 51 was arguably the formal statement by US Commerce Secretary,Penny Pritzker, that the US will hand over formal stewardship of the Internet to “global multi-stakeholder communities”.While some US stakeholders may be appalled by this policy of apparent abdication by the US of hegemony over the Internet,  I believe there is more to this move than meets the eye.  The US policy-makerslikea free and open Internet.  Some might say that a free and open Internet is the ultimate global platform for public influence and, in the extreme case,subversion. A study of the history of US intelligence apparatus reveals that the US is the most advanced country when it comes to monitoring global telecommunications, e.g. via ECHELON/PRISM infrastructure.  The Internet is a battleground where the US is, and will be for the foreseeable future, the best equipped.  As such, it makes sense that the US will support a public policy which leads to a continued free and open Internet with minimal censorship.Fadi Chehade is a professionalThe conference opened with the multimedia-enhanced musings of ICANN ChairmanStephen Crockerand was followed by the keynote by Commerce Secretary Pritzker. Immediately thereafter, ICANN CEOFadi Chehadetook the stage.  Fadi’s presentation laid out a well thought-out vision and strategic plan that balances top-down strategies with bottom-up consensus building. Fadi comes across as a focused technocrat who is amply capable of navigating the requisite technical, commercial and public policy circles that are central to his role.Fadi has already presided over the massive gTLD rollout, which despite delays has gone off without a significant hitch.  Another area that deserves highlighting is the enforcement of compliance, particularly among the 2013 RAA signatories.  While the periodic audits andad hocinquiries from ICANN’s compliance team can at times be a nuisance to the registrars, the compliance enforcement efforts serve an important function, namely to bring the registrars to a unified standard of operating competency.Consistent with Fadi’s consensus-building leadership style, during ICANN 51 Fadi announced the rollout of a new quarterly live conference call with stakeholders to review progress against plan and to invite input from the growing number of stakeholders.  While the addition of these conference calls may seem like overkill, keep in mind that ICANN has to contend with public and private stakeholders from around the world while protecting the interests of registrants and consumers that do not even know ICANN exists, and must do this in an environment where technology is in a constant state of flux.ICANN is very flush with cash and this is not necessarily a good thingThe new gTLD rollout was a windfall for ICANN, which now has a warchest ofapproaching $400 million in cash and investments.  The current headcount of approximately 300 is projected to now hold steady. However, even at 300 persons, the organization is now large enough to have multiple layers of management distributed across multiple locations.  In my personal experience as Founder and CEO ofGlobal Market Insite, a business that grew 100% per year for 7 years to 300 persons, it was the time between employee 200 and employee 300 when the greatestculturalrisks emerged. This is the point in time when a 3rd (and sometimes a 4th) layer of management is added and when the CEO no longer knows every team member, and no longer presides over every hiring decision.Domain Tasting needs to come back into the industryAs some of our customers know, Epik has developed some capability in the area of domain tasting, i.e. the practice of registering domains and then deleting the majority of them within the 5 day delete window. Earlier this year, domain tasting capability was made accessible to approved customers.  One major challenge of providing domain tasting services is that the registries are now enforcing a maximum delete rate of 10%, meaning that any significant volume of domain tasting quickly translates into onerous penalties for the sponsoring registrar.  While at ICANN 51, I had the opportunity to sit down individually withPat Kaneof Verisign andAkram Attalah, President of Global Domains of ICANN to more deeply understand the respective positions on the subject of Domain Tasting.  In short, the registries want tasting.  It is ICANN, presumably serving as a fiduciary, that is holding domain tasting back.  Mr. Attalah questioned the benefit of domain tasting, implying that it mainly benefits speculators rather than long term operators. I respectfully disagree with ICANN on the matter of domain tasting. The draconian policy now in effect is a disservice to the industry.  I look forward to a continued constructive dialog with theregistrar stakeholderGNSOon this topic, in the months leading up to ICANN 52 in Marrakech, and will be initiating a formal Policy Development Process (PDP) to revisit the topic of Domain Tasting. The binary decision to kill tasting was arguably the appropriate reflex response to stop egregious abuses at the time.  However, the time has come to find middle ground.Stewardship of WHOIS  is setting up to be a strategic area of importanceOne of the topics at ICANN 51 was the emerging discussion ofcentralizing WHOIS.  The initial steps being taken by ICANN in the area of WHOIS are harmless and indeed useful, e.g. the launch of anICANN-managed WHOIS search tool.  While further work on WHOIS centralization appears to be preliminary, these projects have a tendency to take on a life of their own once staffed and funded.  A significant change to the WHOIS framework has now gotten additional ICANN air cover byvoluminous analysisby an Expert Working Group. During the meeting with Mr. Attalah of ICANN, I took the opportunity to state my position on the WHOIS centralization topic, namely that I am not in favor of a globally centralized WHOIS model and will advocate against it.  For accredited registrars that are in compliance with their RAA, theymusthave control over the WHOIS record as they are singularly accountable to the registrant to safeguard the record of ownership of the domain, regardless of whether the WHOIS information displayed is public or is a privacy proxy authorized by the registrant. TheauthoritativeWHOIS record should continue to come from the WHOIS server of the accredited registrar. In other words, WHOIS, just as DNS, should remain federated not centralized.  There are WHOIS data quality standards.  These standards can and should be strictly enforced through the established compliance and enforcement processes.  The existing solution isnotbroken.Many thanks to the ICANN team for putting on ICANN 51. Safe travels home for the participants from around the world."
In the Land of the Blind the one-eyed man is King	5-Nov-13	"Truth be told:  a growing number of Professional Domainers arenervousabout the launch of newgTLDs.   The official party line I hear from many domainers is something along the lines of “this too shall pass”.  However in private, now that .ANYTHING is fast becoming a reality, there are signs of tension among professional domainers, particularly those who have a large exposure to the investment thesis of “.COM forever”.  While the future is unknown, andthe gTLD banter is very entertaining, for professional domainers, the gTLD riskcanbe managed.  Regardless of whether you are long or short gTLDs, as Rick Schwartz has eloquently stated, gTLDs represent Opportunity. So, how can professional domainers hedge their gTLD bet without taking on the risk of direct exposure to gTLD speculation during this “Wild West” phase?The next phase is now fully in progressRegistry creation and management is on the way to becoming a streamlined process.  At the risk of inciting wrath from long-time domainers, I will state my prognosis: there will now be an implicit cap on the price of a .COM. The long-time owner of a premium .COM may present the counter-argument that the act of someone developing .ANYTHING implicitly means ANYHING.COM is more valuable.  In the short term, I think that is plausible and indeed have no doubt that there will still be 6 and 7 figure .COM deals in the coming years, whether or not a corresponding gTLD is in play.  However, in a year or two from now, if a brand-oriented investor has $500K to invest, and has a choice between investing that $500K for the purposes of either owning  (1) the .ANYTHING TLD forever or (2) ANYTHING.COM, I believe .ANYTHING wins.  Why?  Aregistrymakes money every time someone registers or renews a .ANYTHING domain whereas ANYTHING.COM only makes money if it is developed to some degree or re-sold at a profit.  The first 50,000 .ANYTHING domains have absolutely no ongoing cost to the registry — not even anICANN fee.So, what can Professional Domainers do hedge their gTLD bet?The title of this blog post encapsulates what I think Professional Domainers should be doing:  become knowledgeable about gTLDs and establish awareness among prospective registrants about their knowledge.  gTLDs are still a subject of very limited awareness.   Consider the following comparison of hits in Google:“.com domain”3,680,000 results“.biz domain”1,780,000 results“.clothing domain”7,210 results“.lawyer domain”4,420 results“.attorney domain”2,600 resultsBased on the above, it is still early days in terms of the existence of authoritative information on how to secure these new TLDs.  Professional Domainers can either (1) ignore this sector, and leave this market to the likes of GoDaddy, 1&1, and Demand/Enom/Rightside (congrats to Taryn Naidu!), or (2) they can thoughtfully engage in the public discourse and, in the process, be compensated for their expertise.  A few strategies come to mind, which I will briefly outline in the remainder of this post.Strategy 1 – Reselling and ReferringEpik’s approach for gTLD marketing echoes what we have done with Domain Name Backorders.  We offer first-come-first-serve pre-orders at a fixed price.  This aligns incentives with the prospective registrant. As with Backorders, the pre-orders are refundable if cancelled prior to registration. The standard pre-order rate is $199. Volume discounts are available.  A key advantage of this pricing model is that the $199 price point leaves room for resellers and referrers to participate in the opportunity.  More on that below.Strategy 2 – Advising and ConsultingThe number of companies who are going to need advice from competent gTLD experts is going to increase.  There are some boutique firms who were early movers in this arena.  However, these specialists may lack the personal connections to decision-makers at deep-pocketed organizations who may be interested in pursuing a new TLD.  Associations, particularly those with large memberships are a good example.  In addition, there are also corporations who are constantly trying to pick up new extensions of theirSLDwho should logically want to own theTLDonce the window for such re-opens.Strategy 3 – Launching a gTLD on your ownThe window for securing new gTLDs is currently closed.  At some point it will be re-opened, creating even more windfall for ICANN while also creating even more variety for registrants and registrars.   Some estimates call for as many as100,000 unique registries.  That number is mind boggling but still plausible particularly if the fixed costs for these registries comes down over time thereby making it more accessible to smaller businesses and brands.Reselling Epik is easyOf the 3 strategies, Reselling is probably the easiest path.  If you have an Epik account, youalreadyhave an Affiliate Account.  Simply navigate over to Account –> Affiliate Program.  There you will see a vast collection of affiliate links and banners to choose from.  The starting revenue share is 20% of any new customer sale.  Commissions are paid out daily.Looking ahead to the next few months, by popular request, Epik will introduce a Reseller API for most of our service offerings, making it easier to integrate these offerings. Details on the Reseller API will be a subject for a future announcement, but for those who have asked about it, Reseller API is indeed on the way.In summary, the rapid growth of the namespace via the inclusion of a vast array of new TLDsisa game-changer.  How quickly this goes mainstream is unknown.  That said, the empirical data is encouraging: even with only limited marketing, the pre-order volumes being reported by registrars suggests that retail end-users are interested in new TLDs.  For professional domainers with a vested interest in thestatus quoof Dot-Com forever, this may or may not be viewed as a positive development.  Yet, by leveraging one’s reputation as a subject matter expert in the area of domain names, there is no shortage of ways to hedge one’s bet as to the future outlook for new TLDs."
gTLDs at Epik: The Sun is About to Rise	23-Oct-13	"Today the world has about two dozen generic top-level domains (gTLDs) including the popular ones (.com, .net, .org) as well as lesser known ones such as .mobi and .tel. Over time, 200+ country codes TLDs (ccTLDs) were created for all countries, e.g. .ca for Canada or .jp for Japan. When the addressing convention for the Internet was developed nearly forty years ago, TLDs helped create structure and boundaries within the Internet. As initially conceived, .COM denoted commercial businesses, .EDU were restricted to accredited education institutions, etc. Of course, at the time, there were perhaps 100 domains, so this structure worked well. Forty years later, there are over 250 million domains, with more than 111 million domains assigned a .COM designation. As anyone who tries to hand-register a name knows, a good one is hard to find.  Simply put, the Internet has outgrown its current naming conventions.The difficulty with finding a short and intuitive domain name is about to be solved.  After many years of discussion and planning, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a nonprofit body that oversees the structure of the Internet, has authorized a dramatic increase the number of top level domain names. Over the next two years, well over athousandnew gTLDs will be made available, with the first new names available in about a month. Among these new gTLDs are names like .LAWYER, .CAMERA, and .RESTAURANT. You can find a complete, categorized list at the end of this post. Epik is pleased to announce that we can currently help you pre-order the names you need for your business or investing needs. Much more on this below.Industry ImpactThe act of dramatically multiplying the number of TLDs is going to materially affect the domain name industry. What is not clear are the specific ways thestatus quowill change in both the short and long term. Are the new gTLDs a vital new way to improve web navigation while protecting and extending brands, or will proliferation of new names only add confusion, driving even more domain investors to the “safety” of .COMs? For many years, the lodestar of domain investing was the “category defining domain name”, e.g. lawyer.com or pizza.com, for which large amounts of money were spent. Are these new gTLDs the next generation of category defining domain names? How does this affect direct type-in navigation, and by extension, domain parking? How will search engines react?The truth is that although everyone has an opinion on the matter, like all sea changes, no one truly knows. Whatisincontrovertible is:The introduction of new gTLDs will have a significant impact on the InternetHow you react to them will be a strategic decisionIt is critical for domain name owners and investors to educate themselves on the gTLDsBut there is one last, incontrovertible aspect of the multi-year rollout of new gTLDs:The vast number of new names, some very similar to each other, will be confusing, making it more difficult to navigate all of your choices.This is where we at Epik have been hard at work — simplifying the domain selection process and streamlining the management of domains across the domain life cycle.Becoming Informed: The Epik gTLD Field GuidesEpik is pleased to announce that we can pre-order the names you need for your business or investing needs. But more than that, we hope to help educate you on the names that are becoming available. We have developed a “field guide” to the new gTLDs. Each new name has a page in which we have placed information that may help size the market or otherwise help determine whether or not to invest in that name or others like it. To start your exploration, go toepik.com/gtlds.Pre-Ordering gTLDs Through EpikThere are numerous tools within the Field Guide to order domain names, either singly or in bulk. You can simply add the name to awatch list; whenever there is news about that gTLD, you will be notified.Among the major features are:Exclusive pre-ordersold on first-come-first-serve basisEasy-to-use watchlistAbility to acquire a spot on a Preferred WaitlistAbility to track specific domain names and/or just gTLDsAbility to upgrade or downgrade pre-orders to/from waitlistAll pre-order fees arefully refundableWe have integrated the preordering and tracking of your new domains into our existing backorder system, as you can see below. Over the next few weeks we will be rolling out additional features, including one that will give you a clear picture of how many people are competing for the same domain name; these new features will be applied not just to our new gTLD pre-ordering system, but to our backorder system as well. We strongly believe that accurate information and a transparent process are critical to any any backorder or preorder system.Categorized List of the New Generic TLDsCommerceReal EstateTechnologyMediaIndustrySportEducation.academy.college.courses.degree.education.ged.how.institute.mba.phd.prof.scholarships.school.schule.science.shiksha.study.universityProfessional.abogado.accountant.accountants.actor.archi.architect.associates.attorney.broker.builders.career.careers.consulting.contractors.cpa.cpa.dds.engineer.esq.holdings.investments.law.lawyer.legal.lighting.management.marketing.partners.vetCommerce.ads.agency.auction.bank.banque.bargains.best.bet.bid.blackfriday.booking.boutique.business.buy.cab.capital.cash.cashbackbonus.casino.center.cfd.charity.cheap.claims.clothing.company.corp.coupon.coupons.credit.creditcard.creditunion.deals.delivery.diamonds.discount.enterprises.equipment.estate.exchange.expert.finance.financial.financialaid.flights.fly.forsale.foundation.free.fund.gift.gifts.gmbh.gold.gratis.group.guide.inc.ira.jetzt.kaufen.limo.llc.llp.loan.loans.lotto.ltd.ltda.market.markets.money.mortgage.mutualfunds.new.now.onl.ooo.parts.passengens.pay.productions.promo.pub.qpon.repair.report.review.reviews.rocks.sale.salon.sarl.save.secure.security.services.shoes.shop.shopping.show.solutions.song.spreadbetting.srl.storage.store.studio.sucks.supplies.supply.tax.taxi.tickets.tienda.tires.tours.toys.trade.trading.vacations.ventures.viajes.voyage.vuelos.watches.xin.yellowpages.zoneReal Estate.apartments.casa.condos.frontdoor.haus.home.homes.house.immo.immobillen.land.lease.maison.mls.place.properties.property.realestate.realty.reit.rent.rentals.villasTechnology.analytics.anquan.antivirus.app.blog.box.cam.camera.channel.chat.circle.click.cloud.codes.computer.connectors.contact.data.dev.digital.direct.directory.docs.domains.dot.download.dvr.ecom.email.energy.epost.express.fail.feedback.foo.forum.fyi.got.graphics.gripe.guru.help.here.host.hosting.idn.java.link.live.lol.mail.map.meme.mobile.network.ninja.one.online.ott.page.patch.phone.pid.pin.ping.protection.safe.safety.search.site.software.space.spot.stream.support.systems.talk.tech.technology.translations.trust.tube.vision.vivo.wang.watch.web.webcam.webs.website.weibo.whoswho.wiki.win.winners.wow.wtf.xihuan.zero/a>.zipMedia.art.audio.book.exposed.film.gallery.media.mov.movie.moviestar.music.news.photo.photography.photos.pics.pictures.press.radio.tunes.videoIndustry.adult.auto.autoinsurance.autos.bio.build.car.carinsurance.cars.catering.cleaning.construction.cruise.cruises.design.eco.engineering.farm.fashion.florist.furniture.glass.green.grocery.hotel.hoteles.hotels.industries.ink.insurance.insure.international.jewelry.lifeinsurance.limited.moda.ngo.ong.plumbing.porn.reise.reisen.solar.tattoo.versicherung.weatherLifestyle.are.baby.band.beauty.bingo.black.blue.boo.camp.cards.care.club.coach.compare.cool.dad.date.dating.day.diy.dog.est.events.faith.family.fan.fans.final.finish.flowers.fun.game.games.garden.gives.giving.guitars.hair.holiday.horse.ing.jot.joy.juegos.kid.kids.kitchen.life.lifestyle.like.living.love.luxe.luxury.makeup.meet/a>.memorial.men.moi.party.pet.pets.pink.play.plus.poker.read.red.rehab.retirement.rich.rip.room.rsvp.run.sex.sexy.singles.smile.social.soy.spa.style.team.tips.today.tools.training.uno.vip.vote.voting.voto.wed.wedding.work.works.xyz.yachts.yoga.youSport.baseball.basketball.bike.boats.cricket.dance.fish.fishing.football.futbol.golf.hockey.moto.motorcycles.racing.rodeo.rugby.ski.soccer.sport.sports.surf.tennisCulture.africa.arab.art.author.bcn.bible.broadway.buzz.bzh.catholic.christ.church.city.corsica.country.desi.earth.eus.gal.gay.global.halal.hiphop.hot.imamat.irish.islam.ismalli.kim.kiwi.kosher.krd.lat.latino.ids.lgbt.moe.mormon.nowruz.pars.persiangulf.roma.ruhr.tatar.theater.theatre.town.ummah.wanggou.world.yunFood & Drink.bar.beer.cafe.cityeats.coffee.cooking.eat.food.ketchup.menu.organic.pizza.recipes.rest.restaurant.vin.vodka.wineHealth.cancerresearch.clinic.dental.dentist.diet.doctor.fit.fitness.health.healthcare.heart.hiv.hospital.med.medical.pharmacy.physio.skin.stroke.surgeryGovernment.airforce.army.democrat.navy.overheidnl.politie.republicanInternational (IDN).企业 (enterprise).娱乐 (entertainment).游戏 (games).商店 (shop)We  encourage you to utilize thegTLD Field Guideso you can learn more about this dramatic change in the Internet, and how you may wish to respond.

Safeguarding your Domain Portfolio using Access Controls	21-Jun-13	"As the world becomes more wired, the need for network security grows more critical. Banks, brokerage houses, and online stores have all stepped up their game to help safeguard personal information and online assets. While it is easy to take registrar security for granted, recent industry headlines demonstrates that registrars are also a target for hackers.  So how exactly is a domain investor supposed to protect their domains?Before I proceed, I should mention that computer and network security is an area near and dear to me. In fact, before joining Epik in 2009, I  spent more than half of my professional career in the area of software security. I have evangelized and marketed security technologies at both Apple and Microsoft, helped build and patented the first virtual private network (VPN) hardware devices and managed security services, and led the development of digital rights management (DRM) systems. Suffice it to say, I have a lot of expertise that is now being brought to bear to help better secure our customers domain portfolios.Access Control is Job #1Access Control Lists(ACLs) provides an effective, albeit blunt force, approach to security. Access control lists contain IP addresses that specify that one or more users are allowed to connect while other addresses are marked as forbidden. The security system does not take note of what resources might be at those addresses–it only cares if you are on the list and know the password. Think of the ACL like the bouncer at a nightclub.At Epik,we have implemented optional, account-wide whitelists. As the name implies, a whitelist contains all the IP addresses (or ranges of IP addresses) from which the account holder has authorize someone to access their  account. The user still must know the username and password. It is simply  another layer of security. For example, you might authorize the IP address of your home, your office, and your iPhone. If a hacker has your login credentials, but is not accessing from an authorized IP, here is what they see:As you can see below, enabling and setting up a whitelist for an Epik account is easy to do. Simply go the the Security tab in your profile.For static IP addresses, simply enter the address. If you have a dynamically allocated address, then I suggest entering an address range, typically 0-255, on the last block of numbers. You can add as many addresses or ranges as you like (although in this case, the fewer, the better). Each address can have an optional label like “Home” or “Office”. You can see your current IP address in the upper right hand of the Security tab.Some security systems also allow users to create lists of forbidden IP addresses called blacklists. Epik does maintain IP blacklists at a system-wide level. The customer-facing domain manager does not have blacklists. In my experience, managing two lists creates opportunities for gaps to appear in the wall you have put around your account. In our system, by explicitly creating a whitelist, you are also implicitly creating a blacklist as well, which is to say, every other address in the world. This help prevents inadvertent gaps in your security. For anyone who has ever used the Verisign Namestore or EPP API, whitelists are in fact thecoreof how Verisign controls access to their registries.For added security, once a user has logged into Epik and started a session, all actions are logged in the background by the system. The intent of the security processes in the Epik system is to safeguard against unauthorized access to a registrant’s domain assets, but to do so without creating arbitrary inconveniences and roadblocks.  For example, Epik still gives the authenticated user instant access to their EPP code for transferring and has never introduced arbitrary registrar locks on domains beyond what ICANN requires of accredited registrars such as Epik.Next StepsEpik will soon introduce additional layers of security. While any single layer could theoretically be circumvented, when deployed together, the chances of unauthorized access drops dramatically. In general, the more challenges the system can put in one’s way, the more secure the system. The trick is to make the system highly secure while not being so locked-down that legitimate users cannot navigate the system. .Epik’s next step will be to soon introduce multi-factor security authentication,  through the additionaloptionof requiring a SMS-based session ID.Later in the year, we will roll out a more finely-grained role-based security system  that can be applied not just to a portfolio, but even to specific domains within a portfolio.  As it is, users can delegate access rights for a domain to another user as well as lease domains.  The new role-based security system allows the registrant to further define access rights, e.g. for use by a registrant’s employees, partners, brokers and contractors.We invite you take advantage of these tools to better protect your domains from unauthorized access and we look forward to your feedback.John LawlerSVP, Products"
The Seven (Deadly) Sins of the Registrar	5-Apr-13	"In July 2011, Epik became an accredited registrar.  The decision to become a registrar did not come lightly.  As an active domain investor, I had a good sense of the market and believed that the registrar industry was both lacking innovation and playing too many games with the registrants. Since 2011, Epik has been building what I believe is a better platform for managing your domains.The Seven (Deadly) Sins of the RegistrarRegistrars employ lots of lovely people.  However, some of their business practices leave a lot to be desired.  This is typically not the fault of the people that you talk to on the phone, but more likely 2 or 3 levels higher in the organization.  Tell me if any of this sounds familiar. I call them the “The Seven (Deadly) Sins of the Registrar”:The Bait and SwitchYou sign up for a free service like WHOIS privacy because it isfree, only to discover that it is not really free, and it is a pain in the ___ to remove it later.  In the meantime, the meter keeps running on the amended terms of what used to be a better deal.The LockupYou change a WHOIS record and find your domain is locked for 60 days, and cannot be transferred to another registrant.  The buyer is adamant that they want to transfer to their preferred registrar and cannot.  Many registrars enforce a full 5 day transfer wait period rather than giving the registrant the option to promptly “ACK” the domain once the transfer has been initiated.The Overpriced RedemptionYou allow a domain to expire, and get a bid on the domain while it is in redemption.  The registrar wants an inflated recovery fee, of as much as $250. The hard cost from Verisign to restore a .COM is $40.  While some markup is appropriate, $250 is clearly punitive.Preying on the UnsuspectingHidden fees, Presumptive Upsells, Small Print, and Automatic Renewals are common in the industry.   Other examples include placing ads on your parked domain, or selling a domain immediately upon expiration without a grace period.  In both cases, the registrar keeps 100% of the margin with effectively no cost.Non-existent or Non-competent Customer ServiceYou call a registrar and wait 10 minutes on hold, and then get prompted to leave a message.  No call back. You send in a support ticket.  Nobody answers.  That is until you file a complaint with ICANN.Not Managing Expiration NoticesICANN audits notwithstanding, a lot of notices are not getting to the registrant’s inbox.  Most registrars ignore auto-responders and bouncebacks, e.g. “Jane Smith no longer works here so please contact Bob Jones. “, or if the registrant has an issue with their mailbox or is using an aggressive spam filter that requires sender verification.Inflated Marketplace and Brokerage CommissionsYou sold a domain. The marketplace that sold your domain charges 30% of the proceeds as a  commission. Proceeds are distributed via PayPal a few days later.  PayPal took another 4% of the net proceeds.  Who ate your cheese?These practices may make sense to the registrar.   However, from the perspective of the registrant, not so much.  After seeing a few too many incidences like the above, I decided to do something about it and entered into the registrar and hosting business by fully integrating these capabilities into our core product and service offering.So, why choose Epik?Since becoming a registrar in 2011, Epik has grown to more than 50,000 customer accounts. Along the way, we added a number of smart, hands-on customers who are as passionate about domain name management as we are.  This has helped us shape Epik into what it is today.  Like many of our clients, over the years, we have had the opportunity to work with many different registrars. At Epik, we are constantly on the lookout for ways to make the experience of working with your domains, more efficient, more enjoyable, and more profitable.Here is what you can expect from Epik:Legendary SupportAt Epik, we provide what we call “Legendary Support”, consistently trying to exceed expectations, going the extra mile. It is hard to explain but you know when you see it.Cost Effective Registrations, Renewals and TransfersWe know that cost is critical for domain investors with large portfolios.  We ourselves maintain a portfolio of more than 20,000 owned and operated domains. Professional domain investors with 100+ domains can expect to get registration servicesat cost, even if those domains are initially at other registrars.  For .COM, our cost including ICANN fee is $8.03.Sell or Lease your Domains Commission FreeDomain Leasing is hot right now.  See myprevious post on this topicfor more background on what Epik is doing in the area of leasing.  Domains that are registered on Epik can sold or leased commission-free.  And because domains are delivered instantly, there are no escrow delays.Free Basic WordPress Hosting, Email Forwarding and Domain ForwardingMost domains start out as an idea. The implementation of that idea, may start a week later, a year later, or never. When a domain is ready to become more than a domain, Epik lets you walk before you run with a bundle of free services.Integrated Hosting and Development SolutionsWhen you are ready to get serious about development, Epik is uniquely equipped to help.  After all, our roots are in the area of cost effective domain development.  As a result, we provide the aspiring domain developer with a one-stop-shop comprised of Hosting, Design, Development and Content-sourcing.Free Privacy that is Easy to UseMost registrars charge extra for protecting your privacy.  At Epik we do not, and will not charge for WHOIS privacy.  Privacy is your right.  Enabling or removing privacy on your domains is easy on Epik.No Arbitrary Locking or Transfer RestrictionsSome registrars impose a 60-day lock on your domains if you change the WHOIS on your domain, or activate privacy.   While we are highly vigilant towards unauthorized account access, we agree that you have the right to move what is yours.100% Rev-share for Parking IncomeShould you choose to not develop your domain, you can use Epik parking.  100% of the revenue from the parking provider is your revenue, and paid out to your Epik Masterbucks account which you can cash out or spend.  Traffic and revenue data is all visible in your control panel.Special rates for Special GroupsEpik aims to provide competitive rates while also providing industry-leading service.  For non-profits and Ministry organizations, we also offer registration services at cost, regardless of portfolio size.  And when we encounter a hardship situation, we do our best to do the right thing.So how is it that Epik can afford to give professional domain investorsthisgood a deal.  Very simple.  When you sell or lease a domain, we gain a customer.  By attracting large portfolios to the Epik platform, we attract more full-service retail customers.  And that is good news for the professional domainer, because when you sell or lease a domain, we’ll take good care ofyourcustomer.If you are looking for a better deal and a fair shake,contact us."
Usability: Making Epik Tools Even More Powerful and Intuitive	10-Nov-12	"Followers of Epik know of our mission to bringIntegrated Domain Name Asset Managementnot just to a handful of domainers, but into the mainstream. Epik is committed to providing industry-leading customer service while at the same time empowering users ofallskill levels to become effective managers of their domain and website portfolios.There are three primary ways in which we aim to “democratize” this concept. First, some large scale domainers owners often have access to powerful but complex tools that let them better manage their domains. At Epik, we strive to provide all users this level of control over their domain portfolios, even if they own just a single domain. Unfortunately, this level of control often comes at the expense of added complexity, which segues nicely to the second major tenet: designing a user interface that hides complexity without removing functionality, scaling seamlessly from the novice to the expert. Our goal is to make things simple, NOT simplistic. And third, we have always prided ourselves on offering what we call Legendary Customer Service, so that no matter how complex the problem, we will help you through it.Setting a Very High BarLike painting the Golden Gate Bridge, software development of a registrar platform is a task that will never be complete — there is always room for improvement.  As part of our goal of building the domain industry’s preferred solution for Domain Management, we have recently revamped that part of our system that controls the most classical registrar functions, including setting up host records, name servers, WHOIS, and forwarding domains.You can see that we have started with a new and reorganized Manage Menu. One highlight of this more scalable design are the subheadings for each menu items, which give you a better idea of what each items does.The bulk of the improvements, however, appear in the new Domain Manager system, which has been organized around the main domain management tasks.You will also notice that the dialogs present the most basic items as a default. You can expand sections as needed to set up less common features. This ensures that experienced domain owners can configure their system as necessary while not overwhelming the average user who only needs to access a few configuration fields.You will note that the fourth task section is called Services. As web services such as Google Apps and Office 365 become more popular, more and more users are being sent to their registrar to make certain necessary changes to their domain settings. These settings are usually spread across several different parts of a registrar’s system, but we have consolidated them into a single, targeted form for each web service. We expect this to save our users a significant amount of time and confusion.These changes are just the beginning of planned improvements to Epik’s system. I invite you to take a look at these new configurations tools and try them out.Looking Ahead/November is going to be a big month for Epik and our customers, as we will be launching several major new features and updates. Most notably, Epik will be dramatically increasing the number of TLDs (top level domains) and ccTLD (country code TLD) we support. Instead of just .COM, .NET, and .CO, Epik will soon support almost every TLD and ccTLD available. From the more common .ORGs and .INFOs to country specific TLDs like .co.uk, .de, etc, you will soon be able to manage your entire domain portfolio, no matter how exotic some of them might be. We will also be stepping up our support for internationalized domain names (IDN), that is, domain names written in non-Latin languages like Arabic or Chinese. In short, Epik will be well positioned to brings it vision of Integrated Domain Name Asset Management to a global audience.And, just in time for the holiday season, November will also see improvements in the Epik Marketplace that will make buying, selling, and leasing domains easier than ever. And, with improved support for third-party Multiple Listing Services, the reach, visibility, and inventory of our Marketplace will be greater than ever.I hope you are as excited as we are about our upcoming releases.As always, we look forward to your always insightful feedback.JohnVP, Products"
Announcing the Epik Content Dashboard: Integrated Content Provisioning and Management	3-Oct-12	"Epik is pleased to announce theContent Dashboard,a unique new feature that offers integrated content creation, provisioning, and management to all our users. Users can scalably order and manage high quality, original text content for any properties in their domain name portfolio, enabling them to improve the value, page rank, and usefulness of their sites.Publishing High Quality Content has Never Been EasierEpik’s new Content Dashboard gives users the tools to thrive in an online environment that now demands high quality, original content. Highlights of the Content Dashboard include:All articles are original and written by highly qualified writers whose first language is EnglishAffordable rates for whatever length articles you requirePlace and track orders directly from your domain portfolioOrder articles singly or in bulkFull editing and publication controlPayments through our standard shopping cart using credit card, PayPal, eCheck or MasterbucksWorks for yourentiredomain portfolio,including domains that are not registered or hosted with Epik.A Bit of BackgroundIt has become common knowledge that web site owners seeking organic traffic from search must offer generous amounts of text content on their sites. For the individual blog owner, generating text for a site is not a particular burden. However, the owner of ten, a hundred, or even a thousand domains cannot realistically hope to personally write enough useful content for his entire domain portfolio.  Moreover, the challenge of finding and paying good writers can be daunting. And thus “content farms” were born: businesses that provided free or very inexpensive content for web sites. These articles were often poorly written, having been outsourced to foreign writers, or, even worse, were computer generated from a list of keywords and SEO terms. The result was a flood of poorly written garbage that annoyed users and distorted search engine results.The search engines fought back, most notably in the form of Google’sProject Panda, which encourages the creation of high quality content through rather draconian punishment of sites containing duplicate or farmed content. Many highly ranked sites stuffed with farmed content had the bottom fall out from under their Google page rank, and many have never recovered.  The situation is now clear:for a site to achieve and retain good SEO and rankings, it must provide value to the user via high quality, original content that is regularly refreshed.EvolutionProject Panda is an excellent example of how the Internet continues to evolve. Epik has evolved as well. Those of you familiar with Epik’s history know that we are passionate about developing domain names into high quality web sites, whether it is for a single premium domain or a thousand niche domains.  In a post-Panda world, we are committed to giving domain owners access to the tools and resources needed to source and publish high quality content — efficiently and cost-effectively. We have done this by integrating the Epik platform with anetwork of several hundred highly capable writerswith expertise in a wide array of subjects. That is why we developed the Content Dashboard.ProvisioningOriginal Content with the ContentDashboardTo add an an article, just click the Manage button associated with your domain:Selecting “Order Article” will bring you to a simple form where you fill in some details about what you want from the writer, including suggested title, article length, etc. The optional “Add Instructions” button allows you to offer specific guidance on several dimensions, including style and tone, structure, format, and desired keywords.  If you omit this, the writer will research trending topics for you.Note that you can also order articles in bulk by selecting multiple domain names from your domain portfolio and clicking on the “Manage All” button.In this case, a 300+ word article will be ordered for each of the selected domains, each article based on keywords found and/or generated for those domains. This is a great way to quickly seed a large number of your domains with unique, high quality content. For domain owners who wish to provide more specific guidance to the authors, or who desire more ambitious content, we recommend ordering articles individually.In either case, whether ordered singly or in bulk, payment is the made using the familiar Epik shopping cart. You can also pay for your content using any Masterbucks you may have earned;this is a great way to reinvest domain proceeds back into your domain portfolio.Once the transaction is complete, the system distributes your article request(s) to a group of talented writers who will compose your articles. Articles are assigned based on several factors, including subject matter expertise and availability. Future releases of the Content Dashboard will allow you to specify preferred authors or characteristics such as ratings; see below for more information. Most articles are usually completed in 2-3 days, often even faster. You can review the status of your articles by going to the Content Dashboard, which you can access from the green “Manage Account” drop down in the upper right of your screen.The Content Dashboard provides a unified way to order, manage, edit, and publish high quality, original content to any domain in your portfolio. And, instead of dealing with six different content management systems for six different types of platforms, you can now use just one for all your sites. Once an article has been completed, you can publish your article with a single click. Or, if there are some minor tweaks you would like to make, you can take advantage of our integrated graphical text editor.If desired, the Content Dashboard can automatically publish content to any standard or multisite WordPress-based site; this is made possible by a custom-developed WordPress plugin that ensures secure communication between the Dashboard and the WordPress site. All Epik WordPress sites and/or WordPress-based solution platforms have this plugin preinstalled. For those of you who have WordPress sites hosted elsewhere, we can provide this free plugin to you so that you can manage your content on all your domains, regardless of whether they are hosted with Epik or not. Similar plugins for major platforms such as Magento eCommerce are already under development.Looking ahead, the Content Dashboard will give you greater control over the assignment of writers: you can specify preferred authors you’ve worked with before, or set certain criteria such as expertise level, feedback/ratings results, etc. This will help ensure that the most suitable writer is assigned to compose your article and that they continue to adapt in response to your editorial guidance.Content Creation is a Key Component of the Domain LifecycleAt Epik, we are big proponents of what we callThe Domain LifecycleOnce you acquire a domain, a high potential way to increase it’s value is to add compelling content. The Content Dashboard provides a unified way to order, manage, edit, and publish high quality, original content to any domain in yourentiredomain portfolio,including domains that are not registered or hosted with Epik.With Epik’s unified approach, content management has suddenly become a whole lot easier and more efficient.Try it. You’ll Like ItI hope you are as excited about this new capability as we are. We encourage you to try the system out and let us know what you think!A 300-word 100% customized article costs only $11.25.  We are so sure you will be impressed with this new innovation from Epik that if you are not completely satisfied with your articles, notify us within 30 days, and get your money back!"
Epik’s Next Chapter: The Future of Domain Name Asset Management	18-Sep-12	"Epik has been a pioneer in the area of developing domain names into income-producing intellectual property assets — a role which continues to this day and which has been chronicled both on this blog and elsewhere.  Now that summer has ended, it seems an appropriate time for a review of our continuing efforts to develop tools and solutions that will help customers get more out of their domain name investments. We call this comprehensive platform approachDomain Name Asset Management.Domain Names Continue To Be An Exciting Asset ClassAs the Internet continues to evolve, I grow ever more enthusiastic about the future of the Internet in general, and in Domain Names in particular.  TheKKR-led deal to acquire GoDaddy,ICANN’s planned expansion of gTLDs, andrising Internet penetration rates worldwideall point to the continued relevance andprimacyof domain names as the addressing and navigation standard by which we’ll navigate the Internet for the foreseeable future. The parallel growth of mobile apps and text messaging, particularly among youth, is symptomatic of an always-on connected culture that has cut the cord and is abandoning mainstream media. Twitter and Facebook should be viewed not as competitive to stand-alone websites but rather as on-ramps for developing new publishers on the web. Just as AOL produced, and subsequentlylost,a generation of web contentconsumers, Facebook has produced a generation of web contentproducers.  Sooner or later, this new generation of web producerswillleave the Facebook reservation and explore new ways to develop their online brand identity.  Many of these future content producers will choose to publish on their own domains, particularly as the tools for doing so become easier and as the professional services for site development continue to become cheaper.Epik’s Integrated Approach:  Acquire, Build, Manage, SellDomain Names have a lifecycle. If you understand that lifecycle and its implications, and if you have the right management tools, you can maximize the productive use of that asset. At the 2010 Epik Developer Conference, we proposed four stages of the Domain Lifecycle:Acquire,Build,ManageandSell.  Then as now, that lifecycle drives our development roadmap. Whether you own one domain or ten thousand, Epik will provide the tools and services necessary to simply and cost-effectively maximize the value of those domain names. Managing your domain portfolio will eventually be as easy as trading stocks or ordering a pizza online.Acquire: Full Service Domain Registrar ServicesIn July 2011, Epikacquired the registrar operations of Intrust Domains. It should be noted, for those who follow the domain industry closely, that Epik didnotacquire Intrust’s brokerage and marketing operations,onlyan accredited registrar, software, customers, and technical personnel. Consolidation of these registrar operations, along with several other strategic moves, has quickly given us critical mass. Today, Epik is a fast-growing and ICANN-accredited registrar serving more than 50,000 customers with domain name management services.The Intrust acquisition instantly added a high level of competency in domain name registrar management, including domain dropcatching. Additionally, the injection of engineering talent allowed us to expand our overall development capacity, enabling us to accelerate our plans to provide an industry-leading platform forDomain Name Asset Management.We continue to get stronger as a registrar.  Indeed, one unique but vital aspect of the Epik culture is that every member of the Epik team, from the most junior staffer to myself (the CEO) —everyone— is actively involved in our customer support function. While a casual observer might question whether this is an efficient use of management time, we all believe that this daily interaction with our customers and our products is absolutely invaluable. I knew from past experience in building successful businesses, that there is no substitute for (1) knowing the customer, and (2) knowing the product. You can well imagine that if the head of development is personally helping customers deal with a problem area in our system, that the issue gets resolved pronto. The time that the senior management team spends on the front lines each day helps to ensure that we focus our efforts on the areas that most directly impact you, the customer. It is a discipline that we consider critical to our design success, and to providing industry-leading customer satisfaction.Build: Cost Effective Solutions for Turning Domains into WebsitesUnless you plan to just park your domains indefinitely, then you will eventually need to develop your domain name into a site. Epik offers a broad suite of solutions for developers.  The common theme of these solutions is that they are cost-effective to build and operate, typically requiring only a one-time setup fee as hosting is included with custom sites. Our all-inclusive approach to development reduces development risk and simplifies budgeting. Equally important is thescalabilityof these solutions: whether you have one domain or a thousand, you can easily and cost-effectively build and manage your domains at whatever scale you require. Solutions are available for Commerce, Directory, Lead Generation, Job Boards, and Video Hosting, with even more vertical solutions under development.For those who prefer to build their own solutions, Epik offers competitive solutions for Web and Email hosting with full cPanel access. And for those who lack the development expertise to realize their unique requirements, we also offer Custom Development services.Manage: Centralized Tracking and Optimization of Your PortfolioWith most registrars, managing a single domain is relatively easy. However, many domain owners own more than one domain. To compound the problem, many of these domains are often spread across more than one registrar, often using multiple hosting providers. Managing domains across multiple registrars, as well as managing multiple websites across multiple hosting providers, can quickly become, well, unmanageable. To solve this problem, Epik allows customers the unique ability to manage all domains across all registrars through one simple interface,effectively creating thevirtualconsolidation of their domain portfolio. In fact, customers can track all of their domains on Epik, and can even do this at no cost.Freeis a pretty good deal.Epik’s integrated approach means that hosting assets associated with a domain can be accessed with one click.  Reporting of revenue and traffic are aggregated and reported centrally, including activity from major parking partners that have provided Epik with API-level access. As part of ongoing domain name management, Epik also offers the use of our Parking Optimization services with 100% revenue share paid out to the customer. The result is a consolidated and managed view of all domain-related assets and single-sign-on into the management of any related sites.Sell:A Better Way to Buy and Sell Domains and WebsitesOur patent-pending online marketplace enables customers to instantly buy, sell orleasedomains and websitescommission-freeand eventax-free.  In a market where competitors charges between 15% and 30% commission, this represents unmatched value for money.Domains are delivered instantly to the buyer at time of purchase which avoids the need for a separate escrow process.  The marketplace is further enhanced via integration with Sedo MLS and very shortly the Afternic MLS.  Buyers of domains and websites have the added advantage of knowing that the traffic and revenue data being asserted by the seller has been independently verified by Epik.  Also, if there are related assets such as historical metrics or hosting assets, these elements can in many cases be automatically transferred in the same purchase transaction.  In other words, buying and selling entire websites becomes about as simple as buying and selling raw domains.What else can you expect from Epik?Legendary Customer Service– Most domain investors are aware of the deplorable state of customer service in the domain industry.  Epik is committed to providing industry-leading service, not just by doing what isexpected, but also by doing what isneeded, adapting the solution to the unique needs of the individual customer, and sticking with an issue until it is solved even if that means corralling 3rd partiesReliability and Ease of Use– Epik’s ongoing investment in software development is among the largest in the industry.  In fact, Product Development is our single largest category of personnel.  Why?  For one thing, as much as we delight in providing exemplary customer service, we also believe that a great product is so intuitive and reliable that it rarely needs customer support.  After all, when was the last time anyone called Apple or Amazon for help.Leadership– During October, I will attend my first ICANN meeting. This is part of a broader commitment from Epik to engage in the dialog around the future of Domain Names as an asset class and the governance of thereof.  Moreover, while we have historically focused on .COM and .NET for our own portfolio, we plan on actively embracing selected gTLDs in our capacity as registrar and marketing partner.In short, the Epik journey continues.  Historically, Domain Name Asset Management solutions were available to only the very largest players in the industry. Today, by integrating registrar solutions with portfolio management, and by ensuring that it is scalable, cost effective, and easy to use, Epik is providingalldomain investors advanced tools for maximizing the value of the domain name investment.Ready to get started?Click here."
Why you probably might not have what you think you have	9-Dec-11	"TheNovember 2011 bankruptcy of MF Globaland the subsequent global search for the million $1+ billion in customer deposits is looking increasingly like the tip of the iceberg. There is a much larger risk scenario that is beginning to unfold.  Pay attention now or suffer the consequences later.Hypothecation is far more prevalent than you might thinkAt first blush, you might think that the bankruptcy of MF Global was an isolated situation where a rogue company acted outside of the boundaries of their contracted fiduciary duties to customers.  And you would be wrong. The reason why Corzine will almost certainly not get the Madoff treatment — at least in the judicial sense — is because his customer agreements have authorized the company tohypothecateandre-hypothecateanything on deposit.So, earlier today I took a look at my TD Ameritrade account agreement and low and behold we have the following on page 6 of the customer agreement, apparently last modified in November 2011:In other words, property on deposit — including cash — is not required to be segregated. It can be pledged, re-pledged, hypothecated and re-hypothecated at their sole description, without notice and without recourse.  If those hypothecated trades go great, the house keeps 100% of the upside. If those house trades fail catastrophically, the depositors have been exposed to the potential risk that they will suffer without recourse if the company were to become insolvent or bankrupt.  This is counter-party risk.  Is it legal? Apparently yes. Is it ethical? Personally, I don’t think so.  Will it end happily? I fear possibly not. That is why I don’t invest in hedge funds, fund of funds, or derivatives.  The opportunity of obfuscation of ownership just too great.  I would rather own something outright — likeinvestment-grade domain names.For more perspective on the issue of hypothecation of custodial assets, I strongly encourage you to read the excellent piece from earlier today on Zerohedge, which you can findhere.  It was one of the most useful things I read during 2011.  If nothing else, it should serve to make any investor more highly conscious of the true counter-party risk for any investment.  Otherwise you just might end up with the proverbial:"
The “Give a Sh** Factor”	4-Dec-11	"One of the people that has been making the rounds lately in the financial media is a hedge fund manager named Kyle Bass ofHayman Capital.   The guy is often on the right side of the trade, particularly when it comes to his bets in credit markets — notably mortgage-backed securities in 2008 and now sovereign debt in 2011.  In arecent interview, he makes reference to what he calls the “Give a Sh** Factor“.  This is the second time that I have heard him use this term.  Strangely, the notion of a “Give a Sh** Factor” resonates with me.When it comes to business, I have learned a few things over the years about building companies — both as an operator and as an investor.  Looking back, I have had at least two opportunities in my professional life when I could have simply retired and spent the rest of my life pursuing hobbies. On both occasions I opted against that route, largely because I believe our Creator put us on this earth not to be idle. I genuinely enjoy building companies.  I am also a big believer in aligning incentives with all stakeholders, notably customers, employees and investors.  Without question, there is a success formula.Earlier this year, the company I founded in 1999,GMI, wassold to WPP Groupin a significant all-cash deal that rewarded the founders and investors for years of hard work.  I led the company as Founder and CEO from 1999-2007, during which time the company racked up 100%annualgrowth and emerged as a respected industry leader.  While the list of Key Success Factors for a company is longer, there are a few core themes that I view as the foundation for serving as anoperating executiveof a business, and especially in leading a fast-growing startup.  As the President and CEO of Epik, here are my top 3:Know the Customer:   On any given day, I talk to 40-50 customers on the phone.  I also Skype with another 5-10 as well as email with dozens more.  The phone number on the Epik site, 425-765-0077, rings through to my personal cell phone which gets answered from around 6 am PT until around midnight 7 days a week.  With ~30,000 active accounts, you might wonder why the President of the company answers the phone. Simple. It has given me unprecedented insight into customer needs and an opportunity to personally connect with many customers. At Epik, weabsolutelygive a sh**.Know the Product: I have always had a passion for technology and software development.  As much as I enjoy talking to customers, on any given day, I spend about as much time working with engineers.  Those discussions are invariably punctuated by customer calls.  While the customer comes first, our passion is for building world class software that we believe will empower a new generation of domain investor to get the most out of their domain name holdings.  Epik is building something that is very, very cool for anyone who wants to Acquire, Build, Manage and Sell domains and websites.Focus on one thing:   This is popular logic. For much of my professional life I rebelled against it, thinking that I could handle more concurrent projects than the typical entrepreneur.  However, in the final analysis, I (humbly) agree that to be an effective operating executive, focus is required.  I am focused on Epik. Why? Of all the ideas to pursue and all of the investment categories to master, I focus on Domain names because I believe thatthe case for domain name investinghas never made more sense to me than it does today.   Epik is in the right place at the right time.Looking ahead, we have some exciting things in store.  As these initiatives come to light, I think it will become increasingly apparent to all that Epik is a company with a very high “Give a Sh**” factor."
Epik Introduces Domain Registrar Services	14-Jul-11	"In the wake of Epik LLC’s completedacquisition of Intrust Domains’ domain registry business, Epik is pleased to announce the introduction of Epik Registrar Services. With Epik Registrar, you can now acquire domain names and have them appear instantly in your Epik portfolio. We believe that Epik’s ability to couple mainline registrar services with domain name backorder and drop catching services makes Epik Registrar the preferred place to search for and acquire high quality domain names. And once acquired, Epik can help you scalably and cost-effectively develop those domains on one of our several domain development platforms.The introduction of registrar services is yet another facet of Epik’s vision ofIntegrated Domain Asset Management. Epik is the only company in the world that integrates the entire domain name value chain — Acquire, Build, Manage and Divest — into one platform. Whether you have one domain or one thousand, Epik’s integrated approach offers market-leading solutions that help maximize the value of your domain name assets.By coupling these management capabilities with a highly knowledgeable customer service team and extremely competitive pricing, Epik is committed to ensuring that the decision to make Epik your primary registrar will always be a simple one.But at Epik, we want to be more than just your registrar. And we want more than to help you develop web sites.Epik’s goal, now and always, is to be your strategic partner in building online success.That is why we have spent so much time and effort building not only development tools, but the entire market ecosystem necessary to turn domains in a financial asset class that will help you meet your financial goals. Domains as an asset class are profoundly interesting, particularly when managed in a strategic, lifecycle-centric way. And today’s launch is a critical component of that management approach.Building the Registrar. And More.Rather than building a new registrar from scratch, we have acquired the registrar business of IntrustDomains. This includes their customers, but most importantly, their extremely robust management tools developed over the last several yearsandthe development team that built it.With the new development team, we plan to re-implement our other admin and reporting systems using the registrar system as its core. It would be a gross understatement to say that I am excited to have this team of talented engineers in our corner. With them and their battle-tested code, we have all the pieces in place to turn our vision of domain lifecycle management tools into reality. You should expect to see the registrar admin console evolve into an entirely new lifecycle manager that will provide a single place from which to acquire domains, initiate their development, manage their content, and track their performance.One important thing to note about the system. A domain investor may have a large number of names spread across multiple registrars. The Epik Registrar enable users to view all domains they have at Epik,even if they are not using Epik as the primary registrar for some or all of their portfolio. Domains registered through Epik (“internal” domains) will be fully manageable from a domain point of view (e.g whois, etc.) while certain functions will necessarily be unavailable to an “external” domain, that is, a domain registered through, say, GoDaddy. That said, our goal is to provide not just a registry service but an integrated approach to managing one’sentiredomain portfolio. There will always be actions that we cannot execute for external domains, and we do recommend that users transfer their registrations to Epik where possible. But it is not a requirement. This makes Epik unique in the industry, and it is a natural consequence of our goal of providing integrated domain asset management for one’s entire portfolio.Just the BeginningToday’s introduction of registrar services is only the first of many related initiatives that will roll out over the coming weeks. For example, we will soon roll out smart domain search capabilities. While the search for a specific domain may determine that it is unavailable, there may well be a dozen similar names that are available. Our new tools will soon help you find alternative names that you can acquire.We will also be rolling out acquisition and development bundles to help you quickly turn your newly acquired domains into high performing sites. And an upcoming integration with Masterbucks will make it even easier to pay for development and consulting services.I also encourage you to offer your suggestions; your input to our development roadmaps is always greatly appreciated.Some AdministriviaThe registrar services are available atregistrar.epik.com. Existing Epik customers who have been accessing admin.epik.com through their Identity.net IDs will find these same credentials will grant them access to the register admin system, and that their domain portfolio should have been moved over.Similarly, those of you who had accounts at IntrustDomains.net will find that your portfolios have also been moved over, and are accessible using your preexisting login credentials. Those of you familiar with the Intrust registrar will notice that we have made some UI changes, some more substantial than others. Other UI improvements will be ongoing as we more deeply integrate the system into other Epik workflows; that said, you should find the system quite familiar and easy to navigate the UI enhancements.ConclusionWith the introduction of Epik Registrar, our ability to help you manage the full lifecycle of your domain(s) has being greatly amplified. The combination of registry services, backorders, drop catching, and of course our domain development platforms, make Epik the idea place to start turning domain names into valuable investments.If you already have an account, we encourage you to explore the system. And if you are new to Epik, create an account and get started with Epik Registrar!John LawlerSVP, Products"
Epik completes acquisition of IntrustDomains registrar operations to add registar management platform	14-Jul-11	"I am pleased to announce an exciting development at Epik — the completed acquisition and integration of the IntrustDomains registrar management platform. The acquisition adds advanced domain management technology, integrated backorder capability, a significant customer base and a talented team with deep competency in the area of domain name asset management andregistraroperations.Why we did this dealWe have long wanted to integrate a registrar into the Epik platform. We ourselves now own more than 22,000 domains. Moreover, we are also one of the most activedropcatchers, adding between 25 and 100 new domains perdayvia dropcatching alone.  Over the last year, we have looked at a number of opportunities to add a mature registrar business.  The logic is that we believe that we are in the business of providing solutions for “Domain Name Asset Management” across the entire life cycle.To do this well, and to provide a truly seamless user experience, we needed to add registrar capability. In other words, it was not enough to simply become a registrar. To eventually become aworld classregistrar, we also needed to secure world class technology for helping registar customers to manage their domain assets.  I believe this deal accomplishes that objective and further believe that the foundation has been laid to become a top registrar, particularly for domain investors who are focused on domain name development as a core business model for adding value to their domains.What we got with this dealWe had already been working with the Intrust team for more than one year. As such, we had a good sense of the potential. Here are the main components of the deal:An established registrar business:Intrust currently serves more than 27,000 clients. These clients will now be Epik clients. We will be serving them as a full-service registrar while introducing them to Epik’s range of development solutions.A world class registrar platform:When you test-driveEpik’s registrar platform, I think you will see what I see — a clean and intuitive interface for managing domains.A self-service backorder platform:Integrated into the new control panel is a self-service backorder platform. Customers who have been using Epik for backorders can now manage their backorders 24/7 and experience seamless domain delivery.A mature Customer Relationship Management platform:Intrust had built a proprietary CRM platform that I think is just phenomenal.  It was designed from the ground up to be used with helping customers with their domain-related requests.A talented engineering team:Talented engineers who understand registrar operations are not all that easy to find.  We are delighted to have added a team of talented and passionate technologists.In summary, this was a big win for Epik and also a big win for anyone who is serious about developing a domain portfolio beyond domain parking.What else you can expect in the near futureThe integration of the registrar capability is part of a larger roadmap.   Here are some additional capabilities you can expect in the near future:An integrated marketplace for domains and developed websites:In the near future, anyone who builds on Epik will be able to list their domains or websites on Epik.  Buyers will be able to see verified statistics about the domain or website. Upon completion of purchase, the domain and associated website will be instantly and seamlessly transferred.Free backorders for Developers:The quality of dropping domains recently has been exceptionally good.  We will offer free backorders to developers. Backorder customers will  put up $199 which gets deposited into the client’sMasterBucksaccount for use with future Epik development services. For anyone serious about domain development, it is an unbeatable offer.Expanded TLD coverage and DNS management:The Epik registrar platform is designed to be a domain name asset management platform which enables users to manage domains wherever they happen to reside. For those of us who are managing domains across multiple registrar accounts, we think this will be a compelling step forward.Integration of web hosting:Epik offers a growing array oftools for site development. However, for users who want to build a truly custom web site, there is a need for an integrated solution which gives the developer full operating system control, yet still makes it possible to enable seamless transition of ownership in the event of a subsequent sale of the developed site.Epik is blessed with some of the domain industry’s most demanding and visionary developers.  I say “blessed” because it is these individuals who continually challenge Epik with new ideas for how we can better equip them to maximize the value of their domain investments.  The addition of registrar competency, opens up a new vector for industry-leading innovation.What this means for Domain InvestorsI have long believed that domains will eventually become accepted by the mainstream as an asset class. I believed that strongly in 2009 when Epik was founded. I believe it even more today.  In fact, the recently announced$2+ billion private equity dealwith GoDaddy involves some of the smartest money on the planet — KKR, Silver Lake and Technology Crossover ventures. Domain names are some of the most under-priced investment assets in the world. As such, a deal like this one was all but inevitable.Where Epik will be different from GoDaddy is in our emphasis.  GoDaddy’s business model heavily depends on volume.  They are the largest registrar with some 48 million domains under management. However,  I believe that the majority of those domains under management are domain names that nobody will ever develop.  So, rather than focus on being the BIGGEST registrar of marginally useful names, our goal is to be a preferred and trusted partner in growing high quality domain portfolios.Try us outAfter more than 2 months of intensive development and integration work, we think we have a pretty solid registrar product.  Our domain registration prices are low for everyone — $7.66 for .COM.  No promo codes needed and no byzantine maze of upsells.If you are an existing Intrust customer, your existing credentials will work. If you are an existing Epik client, your existing Identity.net single-sign-on will also work."
Why new gTLDs are GOOD for domains	23-Jun-11	"The long anticipated  announcement by ICANN aboutopening up the namespace to new gTLDshas received a great deal of attention in the domain industry.  A number of people have asked for my assessment.  My bottom line is that more TLDs is fundamentally good news for domains.Why more TLDs is good news for DomainsThe real battle for domains is not about which TLD one navigates to, but rather I believe the long-term battle is about the addressing system itself.  In my assessment, ICANN is making a historic move that preserves the long-term viability of domains as an addressing system.  Yes, there will be winners and losers created by the act of increasing the available supply of registerable domains. However, ultimately, I think the bigger risk to domains as an addressing system is changing user behaviors, particularly around the broad adoption of low cost mobile devices and the emergence of closed ecosystems on the web.The Contenders that can challenge DomainsWhat are some other emerging addressing systems beyond domain names?QR Codes and machine-readable codes:  QR codes are increasingly visible in daily life.   It has not reached mainstream status in the US, but is gaining traction in Asia, notably Japan where most mobile phones are equipped with a QR code reader.  No need to type in a URL. Simply scan the QR code. In the current practice, this will typically route the user to a web address where the content they are seeking is rendered in a web page. However, that does not necessarily have to be the case which is why QR codes are a risk factor.Mobile Apps: Mobile Apps have moved beyond entertainment. An eCommerce store can replicate the traditional catalog shopping experience using page-turn technology. The experience is highly intuitive and simulates leafing through a printed catalog.  In most examples that I have seen, the ordering process still takes you to a web page to clear a transaction.  That said, payment system integration on mobile devices is maturing quickly and so once again, a redirect to a web page would become optional.Closed Ecosystems: The average web user is spending more time on fewer sites.    They are developing brand attachment to services like Facebook.  These are increasingly closed ecosystems that have near-zero operating dependence on external domains.  If you link out to from Facebook, it will be through a redirect URL.Decision Engines: Search engines are increasingly becoming decision engines.  Rather than take the user to Weather.com, they will simply give you the answer in the search result.Reputation-centric Networks: Twitter is fundamentally a reputation-centric network.   The @whoever addressing system could ultimately compete with email addresses as a primary identity on the web.   Payment services like PayPal are built around email addresses, which in turn are built around domain names.  So far, application services like TwitPay have gone nowhere. I would expect that to change soon when Twitter starts  more aggressively acquiring enabling technologies that builds on their addressing system.  Epik’s own development ofIdentity.netas a network-wide addressing system is partially a response to the need for domain-friendly addressing systems built around single-sign-on and portable reputation.Addressing Systems tend not to go away quicklyIn the history of addressing systems, very few have actually ever gone away completely.  The Telex was replaced by the Telefax, which is increasingly being replaced by scanned attachments.  However, street addresses have not been replaced by GPS coordinates, and phone numbers are not meaningfully different from the 1940’s when Bell Labs introduced the concept of telephone area codes or the 1960’s, the country codes we use today became an international standard. As such, for the simple fact of inertia and entrenched behavior, I expect domains and email addresses will be with us for a very long time to come.Marketing Budgets are usually a zero-sum gameThe primary target for new gTLD are corporate sponsors. So, as a domainer, which would you rather see happen?  Would you rather have Coca Cola spend $5 million on acquiring and deploying a .COKE TLD, or would you rather see Coca Cola allocate that same budget to rolling out a QR code or mobile application?  At the end of the day, more money that is directed at acquiring and maintaining more domain names increases the pool of stakeholders that care about the long-term viability of an addressing system that also happens to offer a level playing field for new publishers to become producers of content using established publicly available TLDs like .COM and .NET.Bottom Line:  The real competition is not other domainsLong-time holders of super-premium .COM domains are probably the most impacted by ICANN’s latest move.  For example, it is cheaper to buy .RETIRE than to buy Retirement.com.  This means the holders of undeveloped premium .COM names have a finite remaining window to turn their undeveloped .COM domains into recognized brands. For the moment, the search engines and social networks are willing partners in this matter. After all, they send free traffic to your site.  My personal outlook is that this pattern will not continue into perpetuity as new addressing systems emerge and as web properties become increasingly effective at keeping traffic on those web properties and not directing users elsewhere.  All that said, domain investors who are proactive and adaptable should do great in a period of rapid change."
Introducing Masterbucks: Epik’s Online Barter Currency	16-Jun-11	"Epik is pleased to announce the general availability of Masterbucks™. Masterbucks is both an online barter currency and the “stored value” digital wallet in which those monies are stored. With Masterbucks, you can purchase goods and services not just within the Epik Network but from any site that supports the Masterbucks API. Masterbucks are easy to spend, and even easier to earn.A Brief Bit of HistoryThose of you who have followed Epik are familiar with EpikBucks. The original concept behind EpikBucks was to create an online barter currency that would inject liquidity into the domain name market. Domainers, often “domain rich but cash poor”, could exchange some of their domains for EpikBucks, and then use those EpikBucks to improve their remaining holdings by purchasing other domains and domain development services. EpikBucks has been extraordinarily successful, creating the liquidity needed for hundreds of domainers to improve their domain holdings. Successful, certainly, but limited to a very particular audience and set of use cases.With Masterbucks, Epik materially broadens the concept behind EpikBucks into an online barter currency available to anyone, and with which they can purchase just about anything, anywhere. Within the Epik Network, Masterbucks will be the primary unit of exchange, and as of today, replaces EpikBucks. As with the now-replaced EpikBucks, a dollar and a Masterbuck are equivalent, i.e. $1.00 =M1.00.Content Creation for Fun or ProfitMasterbucks is a key component of the larger Epik ecosystem, and one of the linchpins to solving a huge problem in the domainer industry. As is widely known, good SEO and high Google page rank depends on high quality, unique content. Most domain investors are not in the business of producing an abundance of original content content, especially if they have to do it for more than a handful of sites. Up until now, the answer has been to source content from “content farms”. However, as Google’s Panda initiative made  clear, a lot of the farmed content is poor at best, and it’s use can backfire. How then can site owners source high quality content in a cost effective, scalable way?The answer is user-generated content (UGC). If dozens or even hundreds of people write content for your site, then you will have copious amounts of the very thing that Google’s web crawlers prize the most: unique, continuously refreshed content from subject matter experts. This content can take many forms, from full-blown articles and product reviews, to comments, questions, and answers.But why does someone contribute UGC? What’s in it for them? Up until now, the answer has mostly been the psychic benefits of sharing one’s thoughts with a large audience of readers — the boost to one’s reputation, and the sense of self-worth that comes when that content is appreciated. Ego satisfaction is certainly an excellent motivator, but, especially in these challenging economic times, so is money. And that is where Masterbucks comes in.Site owners can offer, and users can accept, assignments for content generation which are paid in Masterbucks. The more they write, the more they earn. More importantly, the better they write, and the higher the reputation they’ve earned in various subjects (as determined by ratings, thumbs up, etc.), the higher they are paid; there is, essentially, a multiplier factor for highly reputed authors. Please note that this is a bi-directional effect — a poor writer will automatically earn less than the baseline fee just as a good writer will automatically earn more. Since the amount earned for any particular article is directly affected by their reputation, it is in the author’s financial best interest to write quality content. Write well, and you are paid more. Write poorly, and your compensation drops. In this way, Masterbucks helps ensure higher quality content.New Infrastructure for Content DistributionEpik is reworking its entire content generation and syndication infrastructure in order to support this concept of paid content. Previously disparate system such as Comments.com and Questions.com, as well as articles and reviews, are being rolled into a single new platform. This system will offer common mechanisms for editing and rating content, and allotting earned revenue. Below are some sample design comps. Please note that these are not final designs, but they should give you a general sense of where we are going.You will hear much more about our new content creation platform over the coming months. Suffice to say, Masterbucks and UGC are tightly intertwined and integral parts of the larger Epik vision.Spending MasterbucksAs E.M. Forster once wrote, “One of the evils of money is that it tempts us to look at it rather than at the things that it buys.” How then, to buy things with Masterbucks?As with EpikBucks before, domain investors can use Masterbucks to purchase domains and development services. As for end users, the challenge is to integrate Masterbucks seamlessly into standard e-commerce workflows so that using Masterbucks is even easier than using more standard forms of payment. Over the next several weeks, Epik will be rolling out a unified shopping cart mechanism through which Epik sites (and any non-Epik sites that adopt the technology) can offer a single-click purchase experience using Masterbucks as the medium of exchange. Among the more obvious uses for this technology will be an updated “Buy Now” button on all Epik Product Portals and eCommerce sites.Perhaps of even greater interest, however, may be a related technology rolling out several weeks after that: an “embedded paywall”, Epik’s solution for restricting access to certain online content to paid subscribers. Most sites charging for online content, e.g.The New York Times, place their content behind a paywall; users can either subscribe for a period of time, or in some cases, can purchase access to a specific article. The problem with paywalls is that the protected content must, by definition, be accessed only from the site containing the paywall. This limits one’s ability to syndicate revenue-generating content. Epik’s plan is unique: instead of placing the content behind the paywall, we wrap the contentinsidea portable, embeddable paywall that can be placed on any site, anywhere.Content owners can distribute and/or syndicate their content anywhere they like, and users can view it, for the required fee, without having to leave the site they found it on. Attaching the paywall to the digital asset(s) instead of to the site itself makes it trivial to build premium content sites without having to develop an expensive paywall system. Instead, they simply upload content, and the paywall functionality comes along with the data. Naturally, the payment medium is Masterbucks.Domain Investors can also continue to earn Masterbucks by selling domains to Epik and/or Epik members; as of today, Masterbucks replaces EpikBucks, and all transactions formerly done through EpikBucks are now done through Masterbucks. Existing EpikBucks balances will be honored for purchasing domains and domain-related services.A Brief (But Illuminating) DigressionOne of the alien races in “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine” is the profit-obsessed Ferengi, who do not allow their women to wear clothes, hold jobs, or earn latinum (money). In one episode, a character named Quark attempts is challenge these customs:NILVA: Let me see if I understand. Giving females the right to wear clothes allows them to have pockets. Once they have pockets, they’re going to want to fill them with latinum.QUARK: Which means they’re going to need jobs.NILVA: And once they start earning latinum, they’re going to want to spend it.QUARK: Which means Ferenginar will be expanding its work force and its consumer base at the same time.NILVA: (excited) There will be plenty of profit for everyone!That, in a nutshell, is the value of Masterbucks. Masterbucks provides each member of the Epik Network a digital wallet into which they can store earnings. Naturally, users will want to find ways to fill this wallet, especially by writing high quality, original content, precisely the commodity most needed by site owners. Those users can then use their earnings to purchase the products available on thousands of Epik e-commerce sites. Masterbucks thus provides users a mechanism to earn, store, and spend money, turning them into both a potential content-generating work force for site ownersandan expanded, newly enriched customer base for those very same domainers. I trust that you, like our excited Ferengi, see the opportunity for everyone to profit, users and site owners alike.Next StepsFor both end users and domainers, the first thing you should do is go toMasterbucks.comand create an account. This digital wallet is associated with your Identity.net account, so if you already have an Identity.net account, you can sign into your Masterbucks wallet — it already exists.

Steve Jobs: Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.	6-Jun-11	"With graduation season in full swing, I extend my congratulations to the graduates, and also to the parents who helped them to get there. Steve Jobs’ 2005 Commencement address at Stanford is still a classic and offers a perspective on life from one of the most prolific innovators of this century. If you have never seen this talk, enjoy. I have watched it a few times over the years and never tire of it."
Labor is getting a raw deal.  Deal with it.	4-Jun-11	"Back in February 2011, I stated that theDouble Dip had arrived. That was a somewhat bold statement in February. However in June 2011, that assessment would appear to be indisputable. These 2 charts tell the story of life in uncharted territory.The Macro Story in just 2 chartsThere are many economic charts — housing starts, average home prices, food stamp consumption, etc.  They are all symptoms of the larger structural problem, and that is the rapidly increasing percentage of the population that is unemployed or underemployed, and likely to remain that way for a long time to come.Over the last 20 years, a vast Human Resources infrastructure was created in order for companies to become great at hiring and retaining the dwindling supply of non-retired talent in the “Baby Bust” when the Boomers started to retire. It turns out that we did not need all that labor after all.  Much of those jobs simply went away.On the one hand, long-term/permanent unemployment is soaring stratospherically. On the other hand, loss-making GroupOn is on track for a valuation of $20+ billion in their IPO while hedge Fund manager David Tepperbulldozed his $44 million house in the Hamptons.So, what to do about it?Entrepreneurs create CapitalCapital is winning.  You can win too.  If you start a company, you own 100% of the capital. You can assign a fair value on that capital, and sell some or all of that capital to investors who expect that investment to deliver a higher risk-adjusted return than they are earning on their bank deposits. Does that sound hard? It really isn’t.Despite all of America’s enormous challenges, this is what makes America great:Entrepreneurs who create something from nothing.  As a serial entrepreneur and past full-time angel investor, I have a lot of opportunities to interact with entrepreneurs.  Here are just a couple of recent examples:GiftBasketsPlus.com: Last week, I had a chance to catch up with Rome Dhanani of zqStores, an eCommerce startup. Rome now has a network of 15 eCommerce sites including his flagship site,GiftBasketsPlus.comwhich he founded last August. Rome is using open-source eCommerce software from Magento for which he paid nothing. For payment clearing, he uses PayPal Pro which costs him $30 for an unlimited number of stores.  His traffic comes entirely from organic search. He dropships product and clears an awesome margin. With no full-time employees, GiftBasketsPlus is doing multiple six figures in annualized revenues even before the seasonal busy season which starts in October.EZRoam.com:  Over the Memorial Day weekend, I was visiting beautiful San Diego. While there, I had a meeting with startup telecom company EZRoam.  Founder Connan Twomey has bootstrapped a global mobile roaming company that sells you a cell phone which works in 170 countries. The calling rate per minute is far lower than you will pay your regular mobile carrier.  The solution is popular with exchange students and leisure travelers. After less than a year, he has a proven product and is just about breaking even. He has no debt, and his total investment was $15,000, most of which is in the form of physical inventory.Candida.com: Kathy Kalaf depleted much of her life savings battling candida — a medical condition that often goes undiagnosed.  After a successful recovery from debilitating illness, Kathy made a bold investment in the domain name Candida.com. Although Kathy did not have enough capital to launch the business, she approached Epik about turning her dream into a reality through a development partnership that gave both Epik and Kathy a shared interest in future success.  Epik launched her new site 2 weeks ago.The Bottom LineWithout question, these are challenging times. However, individuals can still maintain control of their own destiny by creating compelling businesses. And for the foreseeable future,I can’t think of a better platform for doing that than on the Internet."
Product Portal Preview: Putting You in the Driver’s Seat	18-Mar-11	"As some of you know, we are in the midst of a redesign of the Product Portal platform, everything from the storefront itself to the admin system, from the reporting tools to the processes in our Ops center. Even though it will not be launching until next month, I though it appropriate to give everyone a sneak peek at the designs and the thinking behind them.The main thrust of the redesign, as always, is to increase both revenue and page rank. Our approach is to put the domain owner in the driver’s seat, or at least, give them the ability to do so. While some owners of Product Portal sites are content to remain relatively passive owners of the sites, an increasing percentage — and most of you readers would fall into this category — have become more active owners, trying to drive increased revenue, traffic, and page rank by taking an active hand in the care and feeding of their site. To be sure, many of the platform enhancements will benefit the more passive owner as well, but this release is centered around giving the active domainer more control over his or her sites.One of the primary emphases is to give useful, SEO-friendly content a much more central place in the design of the site, particularly the home page. This is particular important since many of you have been writing and/or commissioning the writing of SEO-friendly content in order to help generate higher page rank. It seems a terrible waste to hide all this nice, new content.This new section can be used in addition to, or more likely as a replacement for, the “main box” the currently anchors the top of the page. You as a site owner have control over which of these elements, or combination of elements, are included in the site; this includes the new content box, the standard main box, and the featured products box.Each of these elements can be configured individually. For both the content and featured products boxes, you can decide whether to enter your own articles or featured products, or have those articles and/or products automatically populated by the platform itself.We have also striven for a general look, especially of the product grid, that is significantly cleaner, all while enhancing functionality such as a more powerful filtering capability. You will also note that we will be able to flag products that are new to the site or that have had a price reduction, which should help drives both clicks and sales.You will also notice that you as the site owner have the option of including ads on your site: in the header, the right side of the page, and above the footer. These ad blocks can be independently controlled, i.e. you can have any combination of header, footer, and right side ad blocks, from none to all three.With respect to the storefront, another goal is to increase the visibility and use of social networking, be it for reviews, recommendations, or notifications. Consequently, we have made social networking more prominent in the product detail pages, and will also be rolling out a more unified Comments/com/Questions/com element that we think we make them far more useful.Of course, it is critical that the admin tools give you control over all these new capabilities. But having a ton of features isn’t terribly useful if you cannot understand how to use them. We have, therefore, completely redesigned the admin capabilities and placed what we believe is a clear and easy to use interface that should help expose all the features while still making it highly approachable by even the least technical domain owner.And all of this is being tied into the admin portfolio manager, which will be the reporting nexus for all financial and traffic/usage data. You will be able to select a domain in your portfolio and run the usual reports, but now you’ll also be able to edit your site from there as well. You will also see a general improvement in the admin portfolio manager overall.I would like to take this opportunity to thank those of you who provided their valuable feedback during the design phase. The fruits of these labors will be rolling out during the latter half of April. I believe that this update is going to materially improve your experience as owners of Product Portals, and hope you are as excited about this as everyone at Epik is.John LawlerSVP, Products"
What’s with the media blackout on increased earthquake activty?	7-Mar-11	"There has been a lot of mainstream media coverage of Charlie Sheen and his Godess-enhanced clan lately (#winning).  What has not gotten nearly as much attention is something that matters more:increased earthquake activity.  InEpik’s 2011 Outlook, we said to expect increased seismic activity in 2011 (see prediction #6). The last 24 hours has seen some of the most active seismic activity in recent history.  This post provides the uninitiated with a short primer on where to look and what to look for since there is a risk to be managed — including risks for internet entrepreneurs.Increasing Seismic Activity is a Development to WatchAs measured by earthquakes of 6.0 or higher on the Richter scale, seismic activity has been on the rise.  As you can see in the chart below, a meaningful change in the trend started in the early-1990’s.  The uptick is not attributable to improvements in measurement as people do tend to notice the 6-bangers when they happen. For calibration, the recent massive New Zealand earthquake was a 7.0 as was the Haiti quake in 2010 that has killed more than 300,000 people.Today’s Seismic Activity was unusually activeIn a normal year, we would have about 120 earthquakes of 6.0 or higher on the Richter scale.  That means about 1 ever 3 days.  So fartoday, we have had 2 earthquakes of 6.0 or higher.  We have had 21 that are 4.5 or higher.  On the Monday clock, which started a short while ago, we just had a 6.6 in the Solomon Islands — so that makes 3 quakes of 6.0 or higher in less than 24 hours.  Statistically, that is starting to look mighty peculiar.MAGUTC DATE-TIMEy/m/d h:m:sLATdegLONdegDEPTHkmRegionMAP5.42011/03/06 23:45:00-30.983-178.691101.7KERMADEC ISLANDS, NEW ZEALANDMAP4.92011/03/06 22:23:1644.334-129.47310.2OFF THE COAST OF OREGONMAP4.82011/03/06 21:35:4844.372-129.34610.9OFF THE COAST OF OREGONMAP2.62011/03/06 21:15:0019.407-155.2841.3ISLAND OF HAWAII, HAWAIIMAP4.62011/03/06 20:50:3373.0615.99834.8GREENLAND SEAMAP2.72011/03/06 20:01:1760.162-152.48184.7SOUTHERN ALASKAMAP4.92011/03/06 15:48:5452.180142.17710.0SAKHALIN, RUSSIAMAP6.52011/03/06 14:32:36-56.387-27.01984.2SOUTH SANDWICH ISLANDS REGIONMAP2.82011/03/06 14:21:2819.412-155.2613.0ISLAND OF HAWAII, HAWAIIMAP4.52011/03/06 13:46:3540.455-125.4272.6OFFSHORE NORTHERN CALIFORNIAMAP2.62011/03/06 13:40:2632.412-115.49816.6BAJA CALIFORNIA, MEXICOMAP4.82011/03/06 13:35:1652.847160.69844.7OFF THE EAST COAST OF KAMCHATKA, RUSSIAMAP4.92011/03/06 13:09:3452.882160.60549.9OFF THE EAST COAST OF KAMCHATKA, RUSSIAMAP6.22011/03/06 12:31:58-18.115-69.391101.3TARAPACA, CHILEMAP4.72011/03/06 11:26:2626.909143.59810.0BONIN ISLANDS, JAPAN REGIONMAP4.72011/03/06 11:06:2726.903143.63210.1BONIN ISLANDS, JAPAN REGIONMAP4.32011/03/06 10:57:3036.44771.193232.8HINDU KUSH REGION, AFGHANISTANMAP5.02011/03/06 10:52:5226.897143.61010.1BONIN ISLANDS, JAPAN REGIONMAP2.62011/03/06 10:44:1959.472-153.632100.0SOUTHERN ALASKAMAP4.52011/03/06 10:11:36-9.389119.21085.9SUMBA REGION, INDONESIAMAP4.22011/03/06 09:45:2214.021-91.29980.5GUATEMALAMAP2.82011/03/06 08:53:5819.423-155.2623.4ISLAND OF HAWAII, HAWAIIMAP4.42011/03/06 08:39:5253.742159.112158.2NEAR THE EAST COAST OF KAMCHATKA, RUSSIAMAP4.32011/03/06 07:58:4139.20840.35510.0EASTERN TURKEYMAP4.92011/03/06 07:13:2527.023143.68210.0BONIN ISLANDS, JAPAN REGIONMAP4.62011/03/06 05:25:4870.884-6.27810.0JAN MAYEN ISLAND REGIONMAP4.52011/03/06 05:21:07-5.148102.35640.8SOUTHERN SUMATRA, INDONESIAMAP3.72011/03/06 05:17:3660.925-150.01442.9KENAI PENINSULA, ALASKAMAP4.82011/03/06 03:43:31-42.381173.92110.0SOUTH ISLAND OF NEW ZEALANDMAP3.12011/03/06 03:32:3232.814-115.62020.6SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAMAP4.22011/03/06 03:28:1834.80124.96044.8CRETE, GREECEMAP2.62011/03/06 02:36:1162.958-149.38773.5CENTRAL ALASKAMAP5.12011/03/06 01:44:07-23.054170.44835.3SOUTHEAST OF THE LOYALTY ISLANDSMAP2.52011/03/06 01:39:0019.360-155.1592.6ISLAND OF HAWAII, HAWAIIMAP2.62011/03/06 01:31:1219.366-155.1562.8ISLAND OF HAWAII, HAWAIIMAP2.62011/03/06 01:23:4219.369-155.1574.2ISLAND OF HAWAII, HAWAIIMAP2.52011/03/06 01:11:2419.351-155.1501.7ISLAND OF HAWAII, HAWAIIMAP2.52011/03/06 01:07:3219.368-155.1523.3ISLAND OF HAWAII, HAWAIIMAP4.72011/03/06 00:56:0026.953143.70210.7BONIN ISLANDS, JAPAN REGIONMAP2.52011/03/06 00:52:5819.364-155.1453.6ISLAND OF HAWAII, HAWAIIMAP4.42011/03/06 00:18:2523.93394.00169.8MYANMARYou can track earthquake activityhere.The Earth’s Magnetosphere is your FriendThe other development to watch is the state of the earth’sMagnetosphere, as this correlates to seismic activity.  Earth’s Magnetosphere is the protective layer that insulates the Earth from damaging solar wind. This is particularly a concern when the sun kicks out what are called Coronal Mass Ejections as has recently been happening, including a so-called X-class flare last month.Sunspots are a leading indicatorSpots on the sun are a leading indicator. The next so-called Solar Maximum is scheduled to peak in 2012 so we should expect to see more solar activity through the balance of 2011 and into 2012 which likely also means more tectonic volatility as magnetic forces of the sun influence the earth’s iron core.For calibration, the current sunspot number is 114.  The number should keep rising through the current solar cycle — cycle 24 in case you are keeping track.  A good place to look for sunspot account isSpaceWeather.com. I could imagine seeing as many as 250+ during the current cycle.Online Real Estate should do just finePhysical real estate would tend to suffer materially from increased seismic activity.  It would also be a huge strain on already strained federal, state and local budgets. A lot of experts are paying close attention to theNew Madrid faultlinewhich was responsible for a massive seismic event in 1811 and has been relatively inactive until recently.  Since most physical real estate is not insured against seismic damage, the economic impact of a large seismic event is significant.  Investments in commercial property could be completely wiped out, particularly if they are leveraged.  By contrast, online real estate would likely suffer temporary outages. Worst case, one should be able to restore data from a backup and operate from a new data center.   This is yet another reason why I am way bullish aboutonlinereal estate thanofflinereal estate.Be Prepared – back up your dataremotelySolar wind and X-class solar flares are important to watch in general, but if you are in the business of developing software it is even more important. Why?Geomagnetic storms can interfere with electrical systems as was demonstrated in 1989— this was long before we all became heavily dependent on mobile phones and the Internet for communication. A repeat of the 1989 storm, or perhaps more severe, would be something to watch. Fortunately, it takes 3-4 days for Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) from the sun to get to Earth which means that internet entrepreneurs have ample time to take back up data if there is a CME coming our way.This public service message was sponsored byEmergencyFood.com, powered by Epik .  Use the Discount code “Epik” and get a special discount."
"Crackup Booms, Boiling Frogs and Reclaiming Economic Sovereignty"	26-Feb-11	"ACrackup Boomis a term you may hear more often in the next 18 months. The concept refers to what happens when the “velocity of money” suddenly accelerates as money goes to work to escape the impact of currency debasement through massive purchases of alternate stores of value.  Smart money has already figured this out and is moving fast to deploy capital into assets. Although precious metals and commodities have gotten a lot of media attention lately,farmland is a long-time high-roller favorite. Although outdoingTed Turner’s 2 million acresmay well prove to be a challenge,Onlinereal estate is still a wide-open market ripe for large-scale rollups into significant defendable niches.Boiling FrogsIt is said that if you gradually turn up the temperature, you can boil a frog alive.   That is actually a myth, which has beendebunked scientifically— the frog figures out the “hot tub” thing is not working out so great for them and then attempts to escape.  In the world of consumer finance, the frog is getting pretty hot —underemployed,indebted,living paycheck to paycheck, and nowenduring rising costs. On February 22, I declared that the**** is hitting the fan. I stand by that call. The boiling frogs around the world woke up from their “relaxing hot tub”.What about the Dollar and Fiat Currencies in general?I have talked previously at length about currency risks,here,here, andhere. As the following graphic depicts, the tectonic forces are far from done realigning the economic landscape.  The process “ends” in a currency crisis, followed by chaos, followed (theoretically) by a successor currency regime. Along the way, a lot more businesses close, and a lot more folks lose their economic sovereignty — that is to the extent they have notalreadylost it.The Mainstream media would have you believe we are in the midst of a nascent economic recovery and that QE1 and QE2 were good things that accomplished their intended mission of averting a double-dip recession. Not only do I believe we are alreadyinthe double-dip, I would submit that we actually never stoppeddippingsince 2001.  The wealth effect of rising housing prices in the early 2000’s and a stock market recovery were/are an illusion based on currency debasement through loose monetary policy. These distortions in the economic reality have also allowed a portion of the population to become (fabulously) wealthier at the expense of the masses. Mortgage-backed Securities are only one prime example.GDP adjusted for true inflation — Introducing theEpik GDP-Gold DeflatorThe below chart took way too long to create. It is worth a look.  I was searching on the web for any prior analysis that adjusted US National GDP with a deflator based on the price of gold.  I was surprised that such a chart was not easy to find. After all, a Gold-deflated GDP would be a logical way to get a truer gauge of economic health adjusted for the impact of currency debasement.As you can see from this chart, the economy enjoyed a relatively steady upwards trajectory from the 1930’s through 1971. This was then followed by a precipitous fall from 1971-1974 when Nixon took the US off the gold standard in the wake of a global run on US currency redemption into gold.  After a decade of economic pain, it was “Morning in America”, and we experienced the Reagan boom from 1981 through 2001.Most people on Main Street would agree that it has beendog eat dogsince 2001. Consumers have been working longer, harder and smarter (perhaps not!?!) in order to maintain their standard of living. Those folks who did not — or could not — up their game have seen their standard of living drop since 2001.  Of course there is no shortage of economic success stories (e.g. Apple, Facebook, GroupOn, etc.)  but —in the aggregate— it has been a tougher fight for what has actually been ashrinkingpie.  Large companies like Wal-Mart, Microsoft and Oracle got bigger which is why it is still possible to have a rising stock market in a shrinking economy but even that is an illusion as demonstrated by the Dow-Gold ratio which shows that we have been in free-fall since 2001.Put down the Kool-Aid and Reclaim your Economic SovereigntyI would submit that is high time to put down the Kool-Aid, switch off the television, andReclaim your Economic Sovereignty.  I am 100% convinced that individuals can reclaim their economic sovereignty by building globally competitive businesses.  I know of no better way to do this than developing web-based businesses that focus on highly specific “defendable niches” about which the business owner is knowledgeable and passionate. I am also 100% convinced that large corporations have zero competitive advantage in highly specific markets. As we saw from the recent trashing of JC Penney and Overstock search engine ranking on Google, large companies have no advantages in building sustainable ranking in the search engines.Pick one “defendable niche” and go dominate it."
The **** is hitting the fan – Hedge Accordingly	22-Feb-11	"As predicted, the price of silver has continued to rocket.   The story is being chronicled in near real-time byZeroHedge,Max KeiserandTurd Ferguson.   Silver is up a whopping 22% in the last 30 days. Amassiveshort squeeze appears to be under way and picking up a head of steam into the March delivery month with record futures contracts setting up to stand for delivery in volumes that may well far exceed available supply. This is symptomatic of a larger issue — the synchronized collapse of fiat currency regimes around the world.Why is the **** hitting the fan?Massive amounts of printed currency is heading for the exits. Although the house of cards started collapsing in earnest with the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, I believe the real problem traces it roots all the way back to Nixon’s decision to take the US Dollar off the gold standard in 1971. With no gold standard to put a collar on fomenting of more debt-based currency, the US government proceeded to run up the credit card — initially with petrodollars and treasury debt, and now with blatant debt monetization by the Federal Reserve.I fully expect the situation on Main Street will not improve.  Not helping the situation on Main Street, the synchronized collapse of decades of dictatorial rule in the Middle East provides more air cover for currency debasement. The price of oil shot up aridiculous$7-8 today. The **** is definitely hitting the fan folks. All of a sudden, myFebruary 14 forecastof $200 oil is not sounding quite so crazy.Hedge NowOne of the most popular hedges against currency collapse is physical commodities, notably silver which crossed $34 per ounce earlier today and has more than doubled over the past year.Without question, the case for physical silver is strong. By all means, feel free to own some. However, forseriousamounts of money, it has significant  challenges as anasset class. In particular, here are a few considerations before going big-time on delivery ofanyphysical commodity. I will usesilveras a case study:Taking Delivery is a weighty issueA single futures contract is a whopping 5,000 ounces, or 312 pounds. In other words, that stuff isheavy. Mathematically, a $1 million investment is going to mean taking delivery on ~2,000 pounds of cargo.  Good luck transporting it securely over any sort of distance!Taking delivery means storing it securelyPhysical delivery is not without risk. Earlier this month, a Canadian resident reported having $750,000 inphysical silver stolen from his homein a violent robbery.  His life savings in silver bars is apparently missing and untraceable.Taking Delivery means accepting Confiscation RiskIn 1933, the US Federal Government imposed mandatory redemption of precious metals.   This is spelled out inExecutive Order 6102which could be invoked in one or more variants in order to stop the dollar from completely collapsing.Domain Leasing as Inflation HedgeEpik’s domain portfolio has grown steadily over the past year and is now more than 17,000 Development-grade domains.  For a number ofreasons discussed at length elsewhere, I consider domains to be an excellent hedge against a number of economic scenarios. For investors looking for a versatile hedge, one area we are experimenting with is the notion of adomain lease with a fixed-price purchase option. This program will be available for any Epik-powered domains, including domains owned by network partners. We’ll be announcing details of this Domain Leasing program next month as part of continued commitment to developing domain names as a thrivingAlternative Investmentcategory for individual and institutional investors."
Inflation has arrived — Specifically Food Inflation	14-Feb-11	"InEpik’s 2011 Outlook, we said to expect inflation this year. Well, that did not take long. The headlines these days are  full of news of inflation — specifically inflation in the things you need (food, fuel, clothing) and deflation in the things you don’t (a larger house or a new boat).  To date, this inflation hit has mostly been observed inproducer pricesbutnotinconsumer prices. That could well change soon, particularly once excess inventories are liquidated.In the meantime:The supply of things you need is potentially shrinking:  I don’t want to sound excessivelyMalthusianbut for the first time in my life, I am sensing that there is a risk risk of widespread famine.  The group most at risk is the nominally 1 billion people living on less than $2 a day.  However, if the 2011 harvests are as bad as they look like they might be, the pain will quickly expand to those living on $10 a day and quite possibly higher. For calibration, something like80% of humanity lives on less than $10 a day.The Inflation catapult is locked and loaded: Inflation is largely amonetaryphenomenon.  For inflation to occur, you either need (1) more money chasing the same amount of product, or (2) equal money chasing less product. In the case of food inflation, we may have the worst possible combination:more money chasing less product.  The below chart explains perfectly why I think the inflation catapult is primed for blast-off. It awaits a triggering event.The Inflation hawks have left the building: Earlier today, there was news thatNeil Barofsky is leaving his role as SIGTARP. These are the guys who are accountable for where the TARP bailout money goes. On a related note,Hawkish Fed Governor Kevin Warsh resigned last week. Axel Weber, the similarly hawkish heir apparent to the European Central Bank,also resigned last week. The hawks appear to be leaving the building.You may not care about the money supply, and may well not know your M1, M2 and M3. Now would be a good time to get up to speed —beforethevelocity of moneyreturns to trend.  It is also a good time to diversify into assets that have finite supply and that have global appeal.  Personally, I likepremium domain names as an asset class for reasons discussed prior.The Chinese need to eat too — and with $2.65 Trillion in ForEx reserves they can afford to!The big macroeconomic development to watch in the coming months is Chinese food inflation. Month over month, the official number is that it is running aTRIPLE DIGIT annualized growth rate. I have an ongoing Skype dialog with a business partner in Fuzhou, China, who has confirmed that rapidly increasing food prices in late 2010 is now accelerating in 2011. Due to ongoing drought,China’s domestic harvest could take a large hit in 2011.  However, keep in mind that China also has the world’s largest foreign exchange reserves, nowabove $2.65 Trillion.   In other words, in a global market with free trade, their government should be able to import what they need from willing exporters. Interesting to note though thatRussia has banned grained exportsin the wake of their own failed harvest.I goes to follow then that China is the X-Factor in global pricing of food — they would have the greatestneedand also the greatestcapacityto pay for it. Although drought conditions are not new in China, 2011 is looking particularly severe.  This is the first time that I can recall when the world’s mostpopulousnation can also afford to outbid the world’swealthiestnations for a good that is classicallyprice inelastic.Guess who has the largest supply of exportable grain?As you can see in the below info-graphic, far and away the US is the leading exporters of food.At a time when food will be much more expensive, let’s see if the US crop holds up. It justmight, and almost certainly on arelativebasis.  The (geopolitical) implications are significant as there is mounting evidence thatinstability in places like Egypt have their origin in rising food prices.  Said another way, a government would spend as much as needed to maintain control of its population. With43 million Americans on food stampsat a time of record budget deficits, the writing is on the wall that more debasement of the currency can be expected as the global trends towards income equality and wealth concentration continues. Hedge accordingly."
Domains Expire. EpikBucks Don’t!	14-Feb-11	"Veteran domainers know the drill.  We buy domains. We hope for a return, either from operating the domain or from selling the domain at a premium.  However, n the last 12 months, the economic equation ofBuy and Parkgot tougher. As a result, a large number of marginal domains are being dropped.  Is there a better solution? You bet.EpikBucks is an emerging currency for the Domain IndustryEpikBuckswere first launched in 2010 as part ofSwapFest.  The market remains active. In the first 45 days of 2011, more than $100,000 in EpikBucks transactions have been completed.  In many cases, these EpikBucks were converted to cash by selling EpikBucks to one of the active buyers of EpikBucks, usually at a discount to face value.  Epik provides a free escrow service to those who buy and sell EpikBucks.Expiring Domains? Sell them for EpikBucksbeforethey expire.One of the challenges with expiring domains is how to liquidate them quickly before they expire.  Expiration dates can sneak up on you and now you have to make the call on whether to renew a marginal domain for another year, or keep that powder dry for a new domain.  As a result, many worthwhile names end up expiring and dropping, only to be picked up by another domain speculator. Why drop a name when you can sell it for EpikBucks?What are we looking for in an Expiring Name?Most expiring names are being dropped for good reason — they are not great names.  However, as they say, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure.  At Epik, we are happy to help domain owners to sort the wheat from the chaff and make offersin EpikBucks.   The most interesting names to acquire before they drop arenames with Pagerank.  Beyond that, we like names with a high Domain Quality Index (DQI)?Domains Expire. EpikBucks don’t.If you have names that are about to expire, it might make sense to getsomethingfor them.  And while domains expire if not renewed,EpikBucks never expire, are transferable and can be redeemed for a growing variety of goods and services.  Want to sell some expiring domains for EpikBucks?  Don’t know what DQI means?

Why $200 oil and $5000 gold is good news if you are a Domain Investor	5-Feb-11	"I just returned from anexcellentDomainFest 2011 in Santa Monica. Hats off to the Oversee team who continue to set the standard for the Industry. During the conference I had an opportunity to meet with an institutional investor that is already working with Epik. This Hong Kong based investor has significant pedigree in institutional finance and has now assembled an investment fund with the specific mandate to invest in development-grade domain names.  In this post, I discuss the macro view of what I think is going on in the financial markets, along with the implications for domain investors.The Chinese are ComingIn August 2010, I wrote a blog post entitled“The Chinese are Coming”.  Well, I was right. The investment group is Hong Kong based. Hong Kong is in the midst of a massive liquidity bubble and is now also the home of the world’s most expensive real estate — nowabout 2X of New York City.  Many of these investors are now hedging against these inflated assets, including through investment into an expanding array of “Alternative Assets”. The Chinese and Indians, while poorer than Americans on a GDP per capita basis, are in many ways better positioned than their debt-laden American counterparts. In fact, I would argue that Chinese and Indians understand alternative assets better than most Americans.Asset Managers are getting DomainsWhat most surprised me about this meeting is that the investment case for domain names as asset class was something that he had already fully grasped. We could quite literally have taken turns with the narrative.  I was blown away.  At Epik, we often talk about the challenge ofexplaining domain names as an asset class.  When I meet with financial professionals, it usually takes about 10-15 minutes for the light bulb to go on when it comes to the investment case for domain names.  In this case, there was no real explanation needed. He got it and was already attacking the opportunity with a team of like-minded individuals who are backed by private investors who are on the hunt for alternative assets.  Hallelujah!Gold and Silver Bullion –  You can’t take it with you … and if you lose it good luck finding it!When investors talk aboutalternative assets, it is often commodities and, in particular, gold and silver bullion, that is high on the list.  While I see no downsides to owningsomephysical precious metals, I am not a big believer in owning vast quantities of physical precious metals. This is for two reasons: (1) unlike domain names which can be transferred instantly, it is hard to transport physical metals.  Airport security is getting tighter — including for private aviation — meaning that taking physical metals with you over a great distance will be easier said than done. Confiscation is a real and growing risk as one  traveler learned on a recent trip to Mexico where his 150 ounces ofphysical gold was confiscated.  In this particular example, the confiscation is a factual and provable event. Incidentally,the wife of the ex-President of Tunisia had a similar experience. So you see, gold is heavy and metal detectors are very good at finding it, making it hard for even wifes of tyrannical dictators to make tracks with it.  But what if your physical metal simply disappears? How do you even begin to prove that you ever had it, let alone track it down?  Right. Good luck with that. Domains on the other hand can without question be traced to prior ownership.  Domains can also be pledged, including via UCC filings, clearly establishing ownership and contingencies.Bottom line:  with domains, unlike precious metals, if you lose them you can find them!Telling the Story is everyone’s jobDuring the DomainFest, I also had an opportunity to sit down with blogger and domain investor,Morgan Linton, who was interviewing industry players for his upcoming video channel, DomainInvesting.TV. I thought this was an excellent example of what I think is everyone’s job, namely educating the public about the merits of domain names as an asset class. We have come a long way but it is truly amazing how many people still don’t get the enormous gap between the price at which one can buy a domain for future development and re-sale. However, to be clear, and as I will explain in the next section, this isnota get-rich-quick story.Be Greedy when others are Fearful — Be Contrarian and Be Right!Legendary investor, Warren Buffet, has been quoted that one should “Be greedy when others are fearful”. I believe that is entirely right.  There are various other interpretations of the same idea, such as “buy when there is blood in the streets”. This is simply the language of contrarian investors.  As Frank Schilling famously showed a decade ago, the single best way to make a fortune is toBe Contrarian and Be Right.  I believe this substantially sums up the opportunity for domain investors. Depending on how well you can explain your logic, you may find that your neighbors and relatives think you are a lunatic.  However, history has shown that there is a fine line between being a lunatic and being a genius.  If you are a Domain Investor, youarea contrarian.  I believe you are on the right side of history, particularly as the global economy moves from one which was offline-centric, to one that is online-centric.The Party is just getting StartedI believe the mismatch in valuations for domain names is absolutely mind boggling. As a result, Epik has been acquiring between 20 and 50 domain almost every day.  SeeEpikDomains.comfor a sampling of recent acquisitions. We acquire much of these on the drop but also routinely acquire them from domain investors who have yet to figure out that there is “life after parking”. PPC Parking is gasping for air. The good news about the collapse of parking as an economic model is that some truly amazing names can be acquired inexpensively. To this end, Epik maintains 25 registry connections entirely for this purpose.  You can find these gems too.  Check outDomains.Epik.comwhere we publish appraised lists of dropping names every day.Some Recommended Weekend ViewingThe following video is a decent primer on the near-term outlook for commodities and the associated macroeconomic climate.  Nick Barisheff from Bullion Management Group is somewhat monotone in his presentation but content-wise, I believe he got it right:Empire Club_ Outlook for Gold 2011For those who prefer multimedia, here is the “Readers Digest” version of the same narrative:The bottom line for domain investors is this:– Precious metals and commodities generally are not really going up.The Dollar — and effectively all fiat currencies — are losing value.Theillusionis that this is a speculative bubble in commodities.  Speculative bubbles regress to the mean.  That is not what is going on here.  You are witnessing the debasement of the fiat currency regime. As more folks wake up to this reality, they will begin chasing more alternative assets — including domain names.– If oil goes to $200, it would put further pressure on real estate prices.  Not only will there be less discretionary cashflow with which to invest, but the entire economic model of driving long distances, e.g. to work at one or more jobs, will break down. The economics of drivinganywherewill change fundamentally, particular if this oil crisis lasts much longer than the last one, as I believe it will.The shift to an online economy will be further accelerated."
Braden Pollock joins Epik Board of Directors	28-Jan-11	"I am delighted to announce thatBraden Pollockhas joined the Epik Board of Directors. Braden’s company,Legal Brand Marketing LLC, is a recognized leader in the field of lead generation markets.  In addition to making a financial investment in Epik, Braden and Epik will be advising Epik on how to provide industry-leading solutions for lead generation across 29 legal niches as well as expanding to non-legal sectors.  In addition, to his expertise in lead-generation, Braden has developed several other proven alternative domain monetization methods for future application to Epik’s fast-growing network.Braden is a great addition to the teamThe history of Braden and Epik goes back to early 2010.  Braden began working withDevRichin early 2010 after DevRich President, Luke Webster, presented at the January 2010 DomainFest Pitchfest.  When Epik acquired DevRich in May 2010, a success story with Braden was already under way. One year later, that initial order of 500 sites in January 2010 has exploded into a network of  more than 6,000 Lead-Gen sites.  Braden’s company, Legal Brand Marketing LLC, is the leading supplier of leads to DUI Attorneys in the USA with an unmatched web presence for DUI-related lead capture.The DUI Lead Generation businessThe end-user price of a qualified DUI lead is typically between $20 and $100.  As the price of CPC for DUI-related terms has continued to rise, so too has the value of the captured leads. The DUILawyers.co site below is a good example of what an Epik lead-generation site looks like.Is Lead Generation the future of Advertising?The  success of lead-generation business models likeGroupOnandLivingSocialare worth noting.  Lead Generation as an advertising model is a very significant development which frankly even Google is behind on addressing.  I believe this was a factor in the attempted acquisition of GroupOn.  The movement of advertising dollars to CPA (cost per action) and CPL (cost per lead) makes a great deal of sense. Just as CPM gave way to CPC, I believe we are moving to a model of advertising where CPC is giving way to CPA and CPL.  This is precisely where Google is behind — the Google advertising model is almost entirely CPC, meaning they make money on clicks regardless of whether or not the advertiser makes a dime.Lead Generation is not just about ServicesThe beauty of the CPL advertising model is that it allows cash-strapped advertisers to invest in advertising with greater confidence.   Even if the ad campaign ends up costing them MORE, they at least know what they are getting and can model their business plan accordingly.  The CPL and CPA models are by no means limited to service provider categories, it also works for certain types of products. For example, yesterday I met with an advertiser who is interested in promoting a premium direct-to-consumer wine. At $80 a bottle, the winery owner can afford to hand $40 to the CPA advertiser that brings him a new customer that may well be ordering by the case on their second order.An Exciting PartnershipAs this deal came together, it has become increasingly clear that Braden is a world class Internet entrepreneur.  Congratulations to Braden and Luke Webster on building a Lead-Generation success story and laying the groundwork for a scalable line of domain-centric business. I could not be more excited about expanding what is working in the DUI vertical to other verticals.  To this end, Braden, Luke and I will all be at DomainFest in Santa Monica next week. We look forward to sharing more details about this exciting partnership with anyone interested.  In the meantime, to learn more about Lead Generation solutions at Epik, please visit or information pagehere."
"New Year, New Site"	6-Jan-11	"With a new year comes the opportunity for renewal and change, an opportunity that we at Epik have grasped. The end of 2010 was a very busy one from a product development standpoint, essentially doubling the number of development platforms over the past six weeks. We launched two entirely new platforms —epik | Recipesandepik | Video— while extending our family of Directory platforms withepik | Directory Pro. As many of you know, we will be introducing two additional platforms in Q1:epik | Real Estateandepik | Job Board. In addition, we are moving rapidly to incorporate certain core technology components, such as single sign on (SSO), more widely across our platforms. And, perhaps most strategically, we are aggressively ramping up our work in semantic and ontological technologies.So, now more than ever, Epik has a lot to tell the world about how we are innovating, both in terms of technology and in terms of business models and markets. The reality of Epik, both in scope and in the particulars, is catching up to the vision. Consequently, we need a new site that allows us to describe this vision, and its attendant products and technologies, in a far more comprehensive way.Out with the old, in with the newAs you can see, the new site has a crisper design, and yet one that allows us to present a much larger amount of information while not overwhelming the user. More specifically, among the many improvements:Improved structureCleaner designSignificantly more content, both in volume and in detail, describing each platform, including: features, specs, and pricing modelsImproved mechanisms for featured sites, announcements and related calls to actionMore context-specific contentMost importantly, the organization of the site, especially in the product section, has been designed to give us a scalable framework with which to explore in detail the features and benefits of our rapidly growing portfolio of domainer solutions. Of course, any good website always evolves. In the coming weeks, you will see even more changes to the site, in particular new and vastly improved sections that describe the underlying technologies and core components, an improved FAQ section, and capabilities to help create a greater sense of community among Epik members.I trust that you will find the new site as big an improvement as I do, and hope you can find some time to browse the new site and give us your feedback.All the best,John Lawler, SVP Products"
"What to expect from Epik in 2011: Outlook, Predictions, Principles and To-do List"	2-Jan-11	"Happy New Year!In a blog post last week, I outlined themain achievements in 2010. Although our first full year of operation was not without its challenges, overall it was a productive year, particularly for a young company that has yet to take in institutional capital.   This post summarizes my macro view of the state of the internet real estate industry, shares a few predictions, and outlines Epik’s main development themes for 2011.The Macro View on 2011 – Online Real Estate is well-positionedMy enthusiasm for domains as an asset class has never been stronger.  Traditional domain speculators who relied on parking as an economic model are giving way to a new generation of online real estate developer.  I have met with both groups.  The demographics are different. Some courageous old-time domainers have already made the leap to development — guys likeRob GrantandThe Castello Brothers. However, the majority of long-time domain owners appear content to watch in frustration as their gross revenue from PPC converges with their domain renewal costs.Fortunately, the growth engines for online real estate are plentiful.  Here are three main growth drivers for 2011 and beyond:The Internet is outgrowing the offline economy: While theofflineeconomy continues to shrink, theonlineeconomy is having a second boom as a growing number of deep-pocketed companies accelerate growth through organic investment and through acquisition. At the same time,newcompanies will need the raw land on which to develop their Internet presence.Domain Development is going mainstream:  A new generation of domain owners is embracing domain development.  The tools with which domains can be turned into viable economic engines are rapidly maturing. This opens up domain development to a much larger audience of developers who lack the technical expertise that was traditionally required to develop a commercially useful website.Investors are on the hunt for alternative investments: The top-performing investments in 2010 were predominantly commodities, notably precious metals and rare earth metals that are valuable, rare and portable.  Investors are becoming increasingly aware of the growing risks to conventional currency systems. More and mre of these investors will see the merits of domain names and internet businesses as an alternative investment class.The composite of these themes areincredibly bullish for development-grade domains, particularly domains that already have a head-start at development.Predictions for 2011Well, it is the New Year, so with that I will offer up a few predictions about the year ahead. The first 3 are specifically about the domain world. The last 3 are about the world at large.The .com premium will fall:  During 2010, Epik’s .net domains earned more than our .com portfolio — not just in total, but onaverage.  Just as silver is under-priced relative to gold, .net domains and other TLDs are under-priced relative to .com.  The old-timers don’t want you to know this, but you get 10-100X more bang for the buck by buying the hyphenated .com or .net name. I expect that pricing gap to begin closing in 2011.Thedaily drop listswill continue to get biggerandbetter.  As predicted back in August 2010,the double dip is in progress. Measured in gold, US GDPshrankabout 20% in 2010. With77% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck, the mainstream economy is still in the tank. This will result in more distressed portfolios being liquidated or dropped as the pool of traditional buyers find it increasingly challenging to sell to traditional buyers.A major domain portfolio will be acquired: The race is on to control the web. Google is making the boldest moves: (1) vertical integration of content (e.g. Boutiques.com, GroupOn bid), (2) integrated provisioning of services (e.g. becoming an online travel agent), (3) proprietary web access  (e.g. Android, Chrome, Google WiFi).Direct navigation is still fragmented and as such it remains a threat to Google.Corporate Acquisition Boom: Venture Capitalists are expecting a big 2011.  Why? For one thing, Corporate America has more than $1 trillion in cash sitting on the sidelines.  Moreover, the environment for debt issuance is favoring corporates as sovereign, state and municipal debt looks increasing less attractive as a store of value.  For Corporate Treasuries, the risk ofomission(do nothing) is now greater than the risk ofemission(do something).Inflation is here and it is accelerating:  Endless fomenting of currency by central banks will come to head in 2011.  The sudden realization by the public that their cash-based wealth is being inflated away will lead to a mass exit out of cash and into hard assets.  When that happens, there will be too much cash chasing a finite amount of hard assets, resulting another explosive growth year for Commodities and Alternative Investments.More volatility in everything:   The word for 2011 isVolatility: volatile markets, volatile currencies, volatile weather, volatile plate tectonics, volatile public policy, volatile public sentiment. Simply stated, the world is unstable. Attempts by policy makers to stabilize it may have unintended consequences.The stage is set for 2011 to be a year of inflection — a year when the course of history changes.  This would be a good year to be vigilant and diversified. Consider having some extra supplies on hand — seeEmergencyFood.com(a fast-growing eCommerce store powered by Epik).Some Guiding Principles for 2011 and BeyondIn times like this, it is hard to lay out an exact roadmap for the journey ahead. That said, it is possible to articulate some guiding operating principles.  Here are my top 7:Combine the Three C’s — Content, Community and Commerce:  The most successful sites bring together multiple elements of user experience.  They have (1) compelling content, (2) an engaged user community, and (3) an economic model that provides attractive value for money while still generating a profit.  We are working to bring all 3 components to every site in the Epik network.﻿﻿Encourage owner Engagement:  The most successful sites have some element of personality for the simple reason that consumers prefer to buy from a brand that they can trust.  EvenIceCreamMaker.com has a story— a story about Kenny who loves Ice Cream. I wish Kenny would add a picture of himself enjoying an enormous banana split! Hands-on owners are key.  We are providing more practical ways for owners to beengaged.Create Network Effects: Epik is, in effect, a network of networks.  Product portals is a network of more than 11,000 comparison shopping portals.  The sites in the network are linked to each other based on semantic relevance.  As data becomes more structured, the opportunities to create logical cross-links between properties increases.  By the same token, as the network of Developers grows, there are more efficiencies and synergies.Make it affordable to get started:  A key design principle from Day One has been to make development affordable. We keep our costs low and pass savings to Developers who want to build with us. We win when our Developers win. Custom sites start at $249. TheEpikWikiplatform is literally free.  We alsodrop-catch for free. Beyond keeping costs low, Epik pioneered the practice of exchanging domains for development work.Communicate openly and transparently:   The Epik Blog is an important communication tool for the company.  In addition to the blog, in late 2010 we began doing regular newsletters that provide operating updates and instructional how-tos. The company’s internal messaging platform is Skype — we openly share our Skype addresses with Epik Developers who want direct access to Epik staff whenever we are online.Stand behind the product:  When Epik takes on a development, we do so because we believe that a given idea has a right to succeed. That does not mean success will be easy or instant.  In some cases, a development won’t go as planned or a Developer is not a great fit for Epik.  When that happens, we try really hard to make it work for the Developer, one way or another. Almost always, there is a win-win and a path forward.The exact to-do list at Epik will evolve. The operating principles that define the to-do list should remain fairly constant.What will Epik be working on in 2011If 2010 is any indication, 2011 will be a year of rapid innovation at Epik.  Moreover, with a large and growing network of developers engaged in the daily dialog around how to improve, there is a lot more intellect and energy at work on Epik in 2011 than there was in 2010.  Here are some of the main themes that we are focused on in 2010:More Platforms in More Places:  A core aspect of Epik’s development approach has been to use platforms — essentially toolboxes and work processes that are tailored to a specific task.  In 2010 we scaledProduct Portalsand launchedeCommerce,Directory Portals,Video Portals,Lead-Gen PortalsandRecipe Portals. Each of these platforms are continuing to be improved, often with dedicated development personnel. During 2011, we plan to roll out platforms for Job boards, People search, Multimedia chat rooms, Real estate and Financial News.Portable Identity, Portable Reputation, Portable currency:  One of the great challenges of building content into a federated network is that there is more friction when traveling from site to site.  Epik is in the early stages of delivering on the vision of what we have been calling “The User-Centric Semantic Web” — a network of sites that are seamless and interoperable as you go from site to site. During 2010,Identity.netbegan to appear on the Epik network for single-sign-on.  During 2011, we’ll add a single network-wide currency and central payment gateway to the Epik network.Efficient Marketplaces for clearing Inventory of Development-grade Domains and Developed Sites:  In 2010, theSwapFestDutch auction proved to be an effective method for clearing large amounts of inventory.  In early 2011 we’ll launch an online edition of SwapFest. Beyond SwapFest, suffice it to say that the existing solutions are woeful and there is a lot of room for innovation in the world of auction and brokerage.  The question isnotwhether we will add value in the area ofsellingDeveloped sites. Thequestionis whether we will Build, Buy or Partner in order to get it done.Domain Lifecycle Management Tools: Our first foray into domain portfolio management is visible at admin.epik.com.  The existing tools in the control panel are a first step in the direction of offering Epik Developers an integrated solution toAcquire,Build,ManageandDivestdomain assets — all from one control panel.  Improved tools for reporting and analysis is a major theme for early 2011.International Expansion:   We think of ourselves as a global company. While we greatly appreciate the  early adopters from Europe, Middle East, Asia and Latin America, the majority of the developers are based in North America. Also, our content is overwhelmingly in English.  During early 2011, we will announce the opening of a London office to better serve Europe, Middle East, South Asia and Africa.  Additionally, language support will be expanded beyond English.These are a few of the main themes.  We have a few other surprises in store.DevCon 2011 – September 14-16, 2011 in SeattleThe first Epik Developer Conference (DevCon) exceeded my expectations in almost every way.  It was a great event — professional but comfortable, and a good value too. DevCon II will be bigger and better than the first one.  Planning has already begun.  If you are looking for an excuse to visit Seattle, this is a good one.  The date is set: September 14-16, 2011.Best wishes for a great 2011!"
A Late Great Hit for 2010 — Comments.com	31-Dec-10	"Earlier this week, I published what I calledEpik’s Greatest Hits for 2010.  One of the projects that I did not mention isComments.com.  It is part of the larger Epik Ecosystem that is designed to leverage a single-sign-on framework called Identity.net.  The idea here is that you can go to any site, and with one set of credentials and contribute you can post a comment, ask a question, schedule an appointment, buy a product, send a message to another user, etc. Comments.com is now just about ready for prime-time, and is thereforeA Late Great Hit for 2010.Comments.com is coming to a site near youComments.com is being developed as the Epik-wide standard for online commenting.  There are a few other established commenting platforms out there, so why on earth do we need yet another one, besides the fact that it has a really cool domain name? Several reasons:Comments are part of user identity:  A key aspect of Comments.com is that comments are not just comments on the site where they were posted. They also are part of a user’s identity in the sense that the composite of all comments made across all sites also tell others about you — what you think, what you are into, etc.  With comments.com you can easily see all of someone’s comments regardless of where they were posted.Comments also a basis for user reputation:  A well-written or insightful comment is an investment in personal reputation.   Many sites have the concept of “thumb up” and “thumb down”. However, the value of this up/down is limited to that site only.  A global commenting framework provides the basis for developing a reputation that is global and portable.  Comments from the most reputable people are then much easier to spot.Comments should be controlled by the author: Have you ever made a comment on a blog and then wanted to edit or remove it?  Not so easy. Our view of comments is that a comment made on a site is not really the property of that site.  That comment is really the author’s property. The author should have the ability to edit or even remove his/her own comment.  This is a key aspect of how Comments.com is designed. You CAN take it back.Comments.com is being rolled out across all Epik-powered sites:  Product Portals, Wikis, Video Portals, Directories, Recipe Portals, eCommerce and more. Your Identity.net credentials are designed to work across all portal types making it easier than ever to contribute content to any Epik-powered site. This is a good example of what we mean when we talk about “The Epik Ecosystem” and for this it is aLate Great Hit for 2010’s Greatest Hits.Comments.com now operational in the wildBrandon Johnson and Dave Hammack of the Sandpoint, Idaho Operations team produced a short video about how Comments.com is being used.  The demonstration is done with an Epik-powered Wiki. The same principles will soon apply to any Epik-powered portal.The next step for Comments.com will be to publish the API for any sites to add Comments.com to their sites.  Details of the free Developer API will be published shortly."
Physical retail is on the wrong side of history … and what to do about it.	31-Dec-10	"In case you missed it, Bloomberg’s Pimm Fox did a worthwhile interview today on the outlook for US retail with veteran retail industry analyst Howard Davidovitz.  In this insightful interview, Davidovitz throws cold water on the notion of a sustainable recovery for physical world retail.  Just as we are seeing a hollowing out of the middle class — as described at length in apost-Thanksgiving blog post—  mid-market retail isalsohaving a tough go of it. One key reason: online retail is eating a lot of what remains of offline retail’s shrinking lunch.Implications for RetailersWith the exception of businesses that deal mainly in perishable goods (e.g. Whole Foods) and high-end retail (Tiffanys, etc), physical world stores with no integrated online strategy look to me like sitting ducks.  Slowly but surely, they will have to contend with the mounting array of forces that are going to squeeze their bottom lines:Static or Falling RevenuesShrinkingmedianconsumer discretionary household incomeRising competition from online competitorsMobile applications forin-storeprice comparisonRising Cost of GoodsRising producer pricesRising fuel prices (oil just crossed $90/barrel again)Fixed costs for rent, core labor, and business complianceIn theory, commercial rents should come down to prices where they would attract new tenants who then invest in tenant improvements and marketing. However the  economics of those properties make it unattractive to enter into long-term leases at the lower lease rates where the market will clear.How local retailers can compete nationally and globallyThe outlook for local economies remains challenging at a time that state and local government budgets are stretched. For many businesses this is what I call a “deer in the headlights moment”. The deer — or business owner — either adapts quickly or gets run over.  A lot of local businesses are not adapting. After depleting the owners’  savings, and/or trashing their credit, many of them will get run over.Online retail is no panacea for the simple reason that online sales is not easy. To win, online businesses need competitive advantages.  This is one of the main reasons why Epik has pursued a strategy of developing segmented retail stores that are built on category-defining domain names for that specific category.  The domain name, when combined with useful content, is a significant competitive advantage.The reality is that there are still a tremendous number of offline businesses that have yet to execute a viable online strategy.  This is where a great domain with an integrated eCommerce solution makes a great deal of sense.   By integrating product domains with a fulfillment solution, domain owners are well-positioned to help local businesses to become more effective at selling nationally and globally.Case Study: Combining Physical presence with Online SalesMy wife’s business,NaturoMedica.com, is having a record December and a record year.   Their core business is serving (mostly affluent) consumers with personalized medical care.  They are finishing their third year of very robust growth at a time when most peer companies in medical services are struggling.  They also sell a lot of products — medical-grade supplements — which are usually sold to these same consumers who come into the medical clinic.During 2011, Natromedica will also launch an online presence utilizing two strategies: (1) an online business to be called Naturologie.com, and (2) a dropship network that supplies sites that are built on category-defining domain names.  What is worth noting is that (1) the physical store, the online store and the dropship network will all utilize the same inventory, and (2) theonlineretail operations are built on the same technology asEpik eCommerce.Epik eCommerce is a core growth engine for 2011What is unique about Epik’s eCommerce platform is that it is truly turn-key for the owner.  For businesses that are already established offline but need to make the leap to online, it really does not get any easier.For domain owners who don’t have a supply strategy worked out, Epik offers a turn-key solution based on dropshipping.  With dropshipping, there is no inventory and customer returns. The margins are not as high as sales from inventory, but with dropshipping it is possible to have a large selection from day one. As revenues grow,  owners can choose whether to begin inventorying products, or sell to (or partner with) an established offline supplier.To learn more about Epik eCommerce, visit our detailed information sitehere."
Epik’s 2010 Greatest Hits	29-Dec-10	"As 2010 winds down, I thought it would be helpful to look back at the past year and review what was accomplished.  Without question, 2010 was a year of tremendous productivity. 2010 has set the stage for what I believe will be an even more exciting 2011.  This post recaps highlights from 2010. The next post will look ahead to 2011.Overall — it was a great year2010 was the year that Epik made the transition from being an idea into what it is today — a thriving enterprise with an engaged customer base that is making use of a growing array of development capabilities.  During 2010, Epik established a reputation as an innovator and thought leader in the area of scalable domain name development.  Although mission of mass-scale development is not without its challenges, I know of no other company that is further along in commercializing scalable approaches to domain name developmentbased on a unified ecosystem.  Here are some of the notable highlights:Product Portals and eCommerceAs of the end of 2010, Epik operates more than 11,000custom product portals.  These low-cost ($249 setup) portals have become a leading way for monetizing product category domain names.  During late 2010 we also launched a higher price ($2500 to $25K setup)eCommerce platform that significantly increases the economic value-added by clearing actual transactions on either a hosted or managed basis. SeeIceCreamMaker.comfor example.Directory PortalsThe acquisition in 2010 of Octane 360 by Local.com did not come as a complete surprise to me.  We think there is a great deal of untapped potential to developing a scalable approach to directory development. We call this “Federating Yellow Pages”. To this end, we have developed and launched aDirectory platformthat now powers nearly 1000 Directory sites. This is tied into our wholly-owned call center for outbound selling of paid listings.Lead-Gen PortalsIt is not widely known in the domain world, but Epik is the back-end of a lucrative network of legal lead-generation websites.  The principles that power a lead-gen site likeDUILawyers.cois applicable to a much broader range of high CPC categories. In addition to having built a versatile lead-generation platform, we have methodically acquired domains with which to scale the model both as a lead-gen platform provider and as operator of sites.Video Portals, Recipe Portals and UpstreamOn the Epik blog, John Lawler, SVP Product Development, recently announced a series of new portal developments. These developments were first outlined by John at DevCon in September. Since DevCon we have sequentially moved the new initiatives from development to production.  Two recent portal launches include Video Portals and Recipe Portals which generated immediate customer interest. Coming in early 2011 are Job Portals and Realty Portals.Acquisition of DevRichAs a result of the May 2010 acquisition of DevRich.com, Epik secured a number of operating capabilities that have become the core of operations center in Sandpoint, Idaho led by DevRich co-Founder Luke Webster. Sandpoint is providing low-cost on-shore customer service, site production as well as managing supply chain logistics for eCommerce fulfillment.  The DevRich platform continues to grow a customer base for low cost site production based on WordPress.Graphic DesignEpik is well known for the quality of our graphic design work.  In addition to producing custom graphics for more than 500 sites per week, the Epik design team also leads the upstream design for all of our upstream development projects.  The graphics team, led by Ala Dadan, is based in Amman, Jordan and is capable of scaling to meet our growth requirements.Domain Name PortfolioDuring 2010 Epik has been an aggressive acquirer of domain portfolios, particularly from distressed owners.  We have been mainly purchasing domains for cash, but also sometimes in exchange for services or EpikBucks. A sampling of Epik’s holdings are visible atEpikDomains.comandStores.Epik.com.  Although we did secure a number of worthwhile exits, 2010 was a year where it was better to be a buyer than a seller.EpikBucksIn my opinion, the concept of a virtual currency for the domain industry was long overdue. Epik pioneered the solution viaEpikBucksand created a liquid market for the buying and selling of EpikBucks as a currency redeemable for domains and services.  During 2011, this currency will be rebranded as MasterBucks and will become the network-wide payment processor and stored-value currency for all Epik-powered sites.DevConTheEpik Developer Conference(DevCon) attracts a special audience that is different from the crowd normally found at TRAFFIC or DomainFest.  The DevCon audience is interested in the topic of hands-on domain development. The first DevCon attracted many first-time domain investors, some of whom have gone on to develop significant portfolios on the Epik platform and are now the core of a global community of Developers. Without question, a major 2010 highlight.Pioneer AwardThe first DevCon featured an award that we plan to confer annually — The Pioneer Award. The first recipient was of course Rick Schwartz who without question embodies the spirit of Pioneer in the purest sense of the word.The tribute videowas a multimedia masterpiece and was developed in cooperation with Owen Frager and featured video clips from some of the industry’s other great Pioneers.SwapFestTheSwapFestDutch auction format has now been validated on 2 occasions. It is well-suited to clearing large amounts of domain inventory in a short period of time.  The first 2 SwapFests were conducted in a live format.   During Q1, we’ll launch an online version of the SwapFest Dutch auction which we believe will attract a larger pool of bidders who are otherwise precluded from participating due to the emphasis on live in-room bidding.Democratizing DropcatchDuring 2010, Epik has been an increasingly active Dropcatcher through the growing number of registry connections operated in cooperation with Intrust Domains. Although Snapnames remains the most competitive dropcatcher, we know for a fact that Epik is routinely beating out NameJet and Godaddy for desirable names that drop. As a result, we have made many friends in 2010 bydropcatching forfree. We call this “Democratizing Dropcatch”.Epik WikisThis development has not received a ton of media attention but is shaping up to be a hidden gem. Why? Well, for one thing, it isfree.  TheEpik Wiki platformenables domain owners to instantly turn any domain into a website that can be edited by registered users with anIdentity.netaccount.  The Wiki platform has quietly continued to improve and is still free.  Users can also add their own Adsense code and keep 100% of the revenue. As I say, Epik Wikis are a hidden gem.Domains as Asset ClassA key theme for Epik in 2010 was educating a new generation of investors about the merits ofdomain as an asset class. The combination of (1) wealth preservation (2) recurring income, and (3) prospects for capital gain make domains and developed sites very attractive.  During 2010, we have actively campaigned on why we believe “Domains are better than Dollars” as explainedhereandhere.So, thanks for a great 2010I want to take this opportunity to thank the Epik Developer Community and Partners for a job well done in 2010.  The Epik team is looking forward to raising the bar higher in 2011. In the meantime, we thank you for your support and partnership in 2010. As a thank you, and as announced last week via email newsletter to Epik Developers, we are pleased provide a25% discount for orders placed through December 31."
New Platform: Epik|Video	24-Dec-10	"Certain domain names naturally lend themselves to a particular use.HardDrives.com, for example, is naturally suited to be an e-tailing site that sells hard drives, whereas a site likeDenverRestaurants.comwould tend towards a directory of restaurants in, yes, Denver. Such natural tendencies are true not just for domain names but for TLDs as well. Case in point: .TV sites, which readily lend themselves to video content, although there are, of course, many .com and .net domains that are equally well suited for video content.In any case, as followers of Epik know, we often develop new platforms in response to customer requests. When a surprisingly large number of people asking what we could do for their .TV domains, we got to work so that they could unpark those sites. The fruits of those labors isour new domain development platform, Epik | Video.Earth to Captain VideoThe Epik | Video platform allows us to build topic-specific collections of videos, including subcategories. Considerbaking.tv—it’s the holidays, so there is a lot of baking going on— which displays how-to videos on how to bake cookies, muffins, cheesecakes, etc. These videos are currently aggregated from both YouTube and Vimeo, although we plan to add additional video sources in the near future.Visitors can browse through the videos, search against keywords, and let friends know about a particularly useful video through sharing buttons for Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites.Site monetization comes from Adsense-style ads, although the addition of Shopzilla-style affiliate elements are planned for January. Additional features such as playlist creation and sharing are also coming soon.Curation is KeyThe question, of course, is why would someone come to a site that aggregates videos that can be found elsewhere on the web? The keys are curation and selection. Developing a worthwhile video site requires separating the wheat from the chaff. Consider someone interested in videos about the paranormal in general, and of Bigfoot in particular. If they simply visit Youtube, they will certainly find a lot of videos about Bigfoot. Unfortunately, they will also discover numerous videos of Bigfoot video spoofs, user car commercials with salesmen in unconvincing Bigfoot costumes, clips from a bad 1987 movie calledHarry and the Hendersons, and a lot of other extraneous or low quality material.This is where Epik | Video comes in. We don’t simply grab every video available. Rather, we sort through videos from across the Web and remove those that are off-topic, of poor video quality, or otherwise don’t make the cut. The result is a set of high quality, relevant videos that give visitors what they want while saving them time and effort.Our ability to do this in scale is based on tools we’ve developed that let us search the Web for videos based not only on keywords, but also criteria such as video source, duration, ratings, whether the video is HD or not, and many others. This help produce a short list from which our operations team selects the best videos for inclusion. This tool, by the way, will be made available in Q1 to domain owners so that they can continually refresh their site content with the newest videos on their own.A Look Down the RoadWhile the current platform is a great way to build out a video-centric domain name and/or TLD, we have even bigger things planned for Epik | Video Pro, most especially the uploading and monetization of custom, premium video content. Video Pro will allow site owners to upload video content they create directly onto the site, and to create Premium channels only available through a paid subscription at a price set by the domain owner. If we think of Epik | Video as basic cable, Video Pro allow us to create HBO. And, of course, such a site might offer a mix of free and premium content—it’s all up to you.We believe that this model makes particular sense for site owners who have not only a domain name but their own original content, for example, self-help videos, yoga lessons, etc. With Premium accounts, these videos can gain a wider audience without having to give them away for free.Even more interestingly, we plan to give Video Pro site owners to ability to sell premium channels to third party owners of content. If, for example, you had a site about auto racing, you could approach Nascar about having them put up their content on a premium Nascar channel, and share any revenue from those videos with them. For those who have the right domain names, this capability can let you turn your site into a thriving business.We believe that Epik | Video and Video Pro are excellent ways to implement your video-centric domain names. Epik | Video is available today, and Video Pro is scheduled for release in late Q1. As for cost,Video sites are $499/site, but if you order any before Dec. 31, you are eligible for our 25% year-end discount. If you have domain names that you think might be suited to displaying video content, this is an ideal time to unpark those sites and getting people watching!John Lawler, SVP Products"
Epik | Recipes: Now We’re Cooking!	23-Dec-10	"As some of you may know, I’m afoodie, which is to say that I love to cook (when I have the time), enjoy any opportunity to expand my understanding of food and wine, and that I have a rather debilitating cookbook addiction. I am therefore especially pleased to announce the newest of Epik’s development platforms:Epik | Recipes.With Epik | Recipes, you now have a platform with which to build out high quality, high performance food and drink sites that are genuinely useful to site visitors.Main Ingredient: RecipesThe greatest challenge for the owners of great food- and drink-related domain names such as grilled-chicken.com or alcoholic-drinks.com is how to populate them. Even the best name is useless without a sizable cache of legitimately acquired recipes. Epik has solved this problem by building a database of over 10,000 recipes, which we plan to grow to more than 100,000 over the coming months. With this storehouse, we have ample content to match to almost any recipe-related domain—you just need to provide the domain name.More interestingly, all these recipes are saved in a very particular format, one that offers significant benefits to the domain owner and the site visitor.Recipes and the Semantic WebTaken as a whole, a recipe is an inherently structured data type; it necessarily contains concepts such as ingredients, amounts, steps, and durations. Consequently, recipes are an ideal data type with which to bind semantics and data together in order to create recipes easily readable by both humansandcomputers.The mechanisms for doing so aremicroformats: simple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards.  Microformats enable the representation of semantic information within a web page; in simplest terms, the HTML markup now includes the dataas well as the meaning of the data. And with this meaning, information can be leveraged in ways never conceived by the author of the data.In the case of recipes, this format is calledhRecipe. And recipe sites encoded in hRecipe offer significant advantages to the domainer and users:Contextual search: Consider a user reviewing a recipe for Vietnamese spring rolls. Any recipe site worth its salt (pun intended) can handle that. But with hRecipe, the site could offer suggestions for other Vietnamese dishes, or other appetizers, or even other recipes that use similar ingredients. And it can easily do so precisely because the concept of Vietnamese as a cuisine, and shrimp as an ingredient, is understood by the site. The ability to offer superior navigation and menu planning suggestions is thus enabled by the microformat in a way not easily possible for a “plaintext” version of the very same recipe. We plan to leverage and extend such abilities in the coming months.Improved monetization: Initially, Epik Recipe site will monetize through fairly standard ads and then through systems like Shopzilla that can display, say, a list of cookbooks appropriate to what the user is viewing. But with the semantic encoding of microformats, more interesting monetization avenues open up in a way not possible with plaintext recipes. Consider being able to click an “Order All Ingredients” button that places an order on Safeway.com or AmazonFresh. How? Because the site knows all the ingredientsandthe amounts necessary to make that dish!Improved page rank and click throughs: Consider the challenge Google faces. It must scan, try to understand, and classify every web site on the planet. Well, Google likes it when they get help, and encoding sites with microformats is a huge help to Google. Instead of crawling a site and trying to figure out whether the page contains a recipe, a microformat provides that information to Google “predigested”; Google doesn’t have to infer the meaning of the data because the meaning has been directly encoded into the site data. Thus, Google then knows not just that it is a recipe, but that it is a low-cal chicken breast recipe because information like calorie counts are encoded on the page in a standard way. Classification by crawlers becomes both faster and more accurate. Better yet, Google shows its appreciation by ranking and displaying microformatted data preferentially because the data is already semantically encoded; this is all part of Google“Rich Snippets” initiative. And because it has more definitive information to render, it can display search results in a more attractive and useful way.Google’s preference for rich, microformatted data results in better page rankandmore click throughs.In addition, Epik | Recipe sites will enable and encourage users to upload their own recipes to the site, helping keep the site content fresh and crawlable while creating a sense of community, ownership, and virality.For anyone who has ever heard Rob discuss the “semantic web”, Epik | Recipes is a perfect example of the power of encoding meaning and data together. It offers a improved experience to the user, and greater opportunities for monetization to the domain owner.Building out an Epik | Recipe site is very cost effective: only $349/site. Better yet, order before Dec. 31, and our 25% off year end discount applies. I am hard pressed to think of a better platform, or a better time, to build out your food and drink recipe domains. Both Rob and I are very excited about this platform, and we hope you feel the same.Merry Christmas!John Lawler, SVP Products"
New Epik Platforms to Place Under Your Christmas Tree	17-Dec-10	"Usually, the time between Thanksgiving and Christmas is a productivity black hole, with very little accomplished. But we at Epik like to march to a different beat, and so we have formally launched not one but two new platforms, both of which are now being used to produce customer sites in scale.eCommerceMost of you are likely familiar with our Product Portals, which are an ideal way to start profiting from your product oriented domain names with little to no operational involvement on your part. For many domain owners, the affiliate-based approach of the product portals works extremely well. However, there are other domain owners who want an even more complete solution, one in which they are willing to expend more of their time and involvement in order to maximize their revenue. And this is where Epik’s eCommerce platform comes in.Epik | eCommerce is ideal for domain owners who wish to take on greater operational control over their online business in order the reap greater revenue, especially for those competing in categories where there are significant margins between consumer price and the cost of goods.Epik | eCommerce is much more than just a shopping cart—it is a complete online marketing and sales solution platform. Powerful and easy to use, the Epik | eCommerce platform gives you everything you need to market, merchandise and sell your items in an attractive and professional online presence. This highly flexible platform combines sales from inventory, dropship and affiliate into a single, integrated online store with centralized customer service and logistics.Perhaps the most important thing to understand about Epik | eCommerce is that it is qualitatively different from most e-tailing solutions. A site based on this platform is not simply a commerce portal. Rather, it is the foundation for a complete business. And the eCommerce platform gives you complete control over the entirety of that business, from supply chain management to marketing to tax reporting. With Epik eCommerce’s extensive management capabilities, you can take complete control.Read much more about this very exciting platform at/products/ecommerce/ec_features.phpLead Generation PortalsAnother ambitious development has been in the area of Lead Generation. We know that some Epik developers have already had significant success with Lead Development using custom-developed sites. Our mission was to develop a cost-efficient solution and to combine  this with our call center operations for timely outbound selling of captured leads.  We are pleased to announce the start of shipping of this exciting new platform for monetizing domains that match to keywords with high CPC values. We have two lead generation products to choose from.For those looking to scale their lead generation capabilities and reduce the initial upfront costs per site we offer Epik | LeadGen, a very effective and affordable solution for $249 per domain. And for those with a premium domain name or the needs for a full custom solution that takes into consideration all aspects of your target audience, we offer Epik | LeadGen Pro for $2500.A Christmas TreatI have had the fortune to work with Rob for three years, and he is a very generous guy, so much so that he is offering a very sweet deal to finish out the year:for orders booked before December 31, 2010, we will knock 25% off the cost of all portal developments, including our new eCommerce and LeadGen platforms! In addition, if you are looking to grow your domain portfolio, you can also save 35% off of list prices for domains atEpikDomains.com(traffic domains) andStores.Epik.com(developed sites).  Please note that orders placed before Friday, December 17 will also be credited for November revenues which are paid out on Monday, December 20.In closing, I’d like to wish you all a joyous holiday season. I know I am very much looking forward to the new year, which I am sure will be a very successful one for us all. Happy Holidays!-John Lawler, SVP Products"
‘Tis the Season	6-Dec-10	"Call me crazy but I really like seasonal domain names.   They fall  out of favor when they are not in season but come roaring back when  their season comes around.  This year is no exception as many of the top  performers for November and December are related to the winter and  winter holiday season.Included in the Epik top-100 product portals we have the following Christmas names:christmasstockingpattern.comchristmasornamentideas.comoutdoorchristmasornaments.comguitarornaments.comstockingschristmas.comgiftornaments.comirishornament.comlightedwreaths.comsantafigurines.netchristmastoysoldier.comchristmaswallhangings.comSome of these sites are relatively new yet already monetizing nicely.  For 2010, we are only monetizing via affiliate but for 2011 will be  looking at eCommerce as the margins on these products are insanely high  if you are importing these goods.Also in the top 100, we see a lot of winter apparel, for example:holidayblouses.comconvertiblemittens.comredeveningdress.comgoatskingloves.comelbowlengthgloves.comsherpajacket.comembroideredsweaters.comladieswinterhats.comAny day now I expect to see a spike in jewelry-related sites as guys  take care of last minute shopping.  However, some early winners are  appearing:catnecklace.comlittlegirlsjewelry.comgoldwatches.netmomring.comovallockets.comswissarmywatches.netYou can find these and more atstores.epik.com.   To note, the November revenue cycle is paid out on December 20, and  December is paid out on January 20.  If someone buys these sites before  December 16, the new owner gets the NovemberandDecember 2010 revenues paid to them.   Buyers can settle with cash, EpikBucks or interest-free financing.And now for your holiday entertainmentOn the weekend, I was taking care of some holiday errands.  After  hearing Taylor Swift’s holiday CD for the Nth time, I could take it no  longer and switched to the radio. On comes the Adam Sandler holiday  classic — The Chanukah song. Still hilarious.  If you have never seen  the live version, it is a classic:Happy Holidays to all."
Trainwreck: 77% of American workers are living paycheck to paycheck	5-Dec-10	"By now, for most people, Thanksgiving 2010 is a distant memory.  In  my case, I will remember this one for a very long time to come.   Thanksgiving 2010 was when I fully grasped the concept of “Two  Americas”.  This year, we spent Thanksgiving in New York City where we  met up with my extended family.  We had a great time –  Thanksgiving Day  Parade, Broadway show, Times Square, 5th Avenue, SoHo, Chelsea Market,  skating in Bryant Park, Knicks game, etc..  We had a great time but  something was not right.So what’s wrong with this picture?On the Sunday morning after Thanksgiving I found myself at the  Apple Store on 5th Avenue in Midtown-Manhattan. The place was packed. I  was there to exchange a new Macbook for my son, Jack, that we had bought  the day before. Jack had found a single pixel defect on the screen of  his newly-purchased Macbook. While waiting for the replacement Macbook, I  observed 2 undercover security guys grab a young man by the collar and  escort him into a room. The suspected shoplifter was a young black man —  I am guessing about 20 years old.  I looked around the store. This  fellow was the only black person in the entire store who wasn’t an  employee of the Apple store. The Apple employee who was assisting me  explained that this happened on a near-daily basis.Minutes later I left the Apple store to meet up with my family at the  FAO Schwarz toy store. I walked out of the Apple store, took a sharp  left, walked past 2 smiling Beefeaters standing in front of FAO Schwarz  and made my way to the second floor where the family was observing a  live performance on the famous FAO Schwarz Big Piano.  If you have never  seen such a performance in person, it is entertaining and looks  something like this:After the performance, the crowd applauded enthusiastically. One of the  performers then made a brief remark about the performance. The  performance itself was memorable. However, the part I willneverforget was this:  you could own one of these Big pianos for $150,000.   Does that include delivery and installation…? And if you walk one block  west — past the panhandlers — there isDylan’s Candy Bar, where it is not too late to order your $15,000 walk-in gingerbread house.  Can’t make it to NYC…? No problem.Neiman Marcus will ship it to you.On 5th Avenue, the luxury stores were packed. It was standing room  only in the Louis Vuitton store. Broadway shows were sold out at $250  per ticket for seats in the Mezzanine.  We returned home last Sunday  evening to a mailbox full of catalogs with more luxury must-haves. Not.Here is theotherAmericaAccording to anational survey by CareerBuilder.com,77% of all workers in America are now living paycheck to paycheck up  from 40% 3 years ago.  Although this is a shocking statistic, it is in  line with the inequality trend that I have previously blogged about  here:The Gini is out of the bottle.   One year later, the trend has gotten worse as the proportion of the  economy attributable to government spending continues to rocket higher.   And even with the government subsidy, the top 0.1% earns more than the  bottom 50%.As of November 2010, nearly 43 million persons in the US are nowsubsisting on Foodstamps, an all-time high.  The average monthly assistance per person is about $130. At the same time,food prices have started to spike.  Keep in mind thatto be eligible for Food stamps— now called SNAP — you need to have not more than $2,000 in “countable resources”.  In other words, you have to becompletelybrokeMeanwhile, the November Non-farm Payroll (NFP) numbers came out on  Friday.  As I feared, the numbers were horrible — only 39,000 jobs  created versus the forecast number of 150,000.  Masked in the NFP number  is that a very large proportion of the payroll is shifting from  full-time to part-time.Also, masked here is that the welfare state is collapsing.  During  December, two million long-term unemployed are likely to lose their  long-time Federal unemployment benefits. In February 2011, it looks like  there will be four million long-term unemployed with no benefits.In theory, the Federal government can at least fund these  Welfare-state operations through issuance of Treasury debt — a  significant portion of which can be monetized by the Federal Reserve.  The States cannot monetize their debts denominated in Federal Reserve  Notes. And therein lies the trainwreck called America.Surviving and Thriving in the era of Two AmericasConsider the consumer tech darling, Apple. Apple manufactures a laptop  computer that is comprised of say $400 in (mostly imported) costs which  it then sells at retail for say $1,500. The economics of that business  are fantastic which is why Apple is sitting on a $44 billion cash hoard.  Apple charges enough that it can pay a fair wage to its employees,  provide great customer service, export to the world, and deliver a  fantastic return to shareholders.  America would be very different if we  had another one hundred Apples.The reality is that most businesses are not Apple — a closed  technology ecosystem wrapped around an amazingly strong brand led by a  profoundly effective leader.  As such, the prospect of selling high  margin product to the masses is not readily available to most  entrepreneurs.  Most products are non-differentiated commodity products  vulnerable to instant price comparison.  If you can sell a product for  $40 with $5 shipping, and someone else sells it for $2 less, odds are  good, you lose.  There is almost no profit to be made in that  environment which iswhy I don’t envy Amazon.So, how can a business hope to create a foundation on which to earn a  sustainable margin?  In this age of instant price discovery and brutal  competition for share of wallet, I think there are really three core  models that can thrive in this climate:Deliver compelling value in a winnable niche — Be the Amazon of  ____:  If you are going to sell to the masses, you will need a superior  value proposition. Spend a few hours on a site like Alibaba.com and you  will see the true cost of products — fashionable earmuffs cost about  $0.20, swim goggles about $1.25, etc., an ice cream maker about $10.   Shipping a 20-foot container costs about $2200 from inland China to a  west coast port city like Seattle. Shipping a 40-foot container costs  about $2700.  Sure, Wal-Mart will pay less but notthatmuch  less. If you want to be the best at selling high margin non-perishable  consumer good online, there is an abundance of product that can be  imported profitably. An exact match domain name can be the foundation on  which to sell a compelling value proposition in volume.Create a brand that offers a unique promise that has broad appeal:    Building a great brand often requires laser focus on delivering on a  promise that is implied in that brand. A great brand is often planned to  the smallest detail — environmental design, packaging, fonts, colors,  etc.  Moreover, veteran marketers know that the best brands are built on  stories — the story of how the brand came into existence. Think about  famous brands that you know and you will likely know the story of how  those brands were created.  The implied promise of a brand is the  foundation on which consumers build trust and even emotional connection  which is what gives brands pricing power, brand loyalty, word of mouth,  etc. Brands can be huge (e.g. Apple, Virgin, Trump) or specialized (e.g.  Burts Bees, Airborne).Offer an Ultra-Premium product which appeals to a demographic that can afford it:  The top 5-10% of American households are doing just fine.  In  addition, a growing number of emerging economies have pockets of extreme  wealth.   For the truly rich, the very best has a high price.  In fact,  for the truly rich,priceis a value signal.  For the truly  rich, if the price is too low, many won’t buy it because (1) lesser  mortals can afford it, and (2) the quality is probably not to their  standard.  Ultra-premium is a hit and miss business but there is always a  market for the best of the best. In bad times, only the rich can afford  them. In good times, the less-rich aspire to afford them.  Still don’t  get it? Flip through a copy of the Robb Report or stroll through Neimans  and take note. I am not saying it is rational. It is what it is.Entrepreneurship still works. Stumped for ideas? Subscribe to Inc  Magazine — it is full of practical case studies of folks who are  building businesses from the ground up with little or no capital. The  local library probably has the back issues.Do you know someone who needs a good domain name on which to build a business?  Check out the inventory atstores.epik.com(turn-key stores),EpikDomains(undeveloped domains).  Assuming it is an Epik-owned domain, we are  happy to provide interest-free financing or consider offers.The Week AheadOn Sunday evening, at 7 pm ET,Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will be on 60 minutes.    This is his second appearance on 60 Minutes. The last time he appeared  on 60 minutes was a week after the 2009 low on the Dow of 6440.  I think  this means one of two things: (1) the fix is in and the Dow is heading  higher in dollar terms, though not in gold/silver terms, or (2) the Fed  fears they are losing control of the situation.  The timing of this  broadcast is interesting for two reasons:There is a global short squeeze under way in the market for physical  silver with one very large Fed member bank (JP Morgan Chase) reportedly  with a bet-the-company short position.  December is a delivery month  for Comex silver. The last delivery month was September 2010.  In  September 2010, there were contracts for delivery of 12.5 million ounces  of silver. ForDecember 2010, the contracts outstanding for delivery are 86 million ounceswhich may or may not be available for delivery. Oops.On Tuesday, December 7, there are rumored plans for a Pan-Europeangrassroots bank run initially promoted by Manchester United soccer player Eric Cantona.   I have no idea whether this will amount to anything. However, if it  takes root, and it just might, the implications for highly levered  European banks would not be good.  It is worth noting that theFed previously bailed out European banksduring an earlier liquidity crisis.Anyway, sorry for the long post. If you got this far, hopefully you  at least understand where my head is at these days.  The fact is that  the internet economy is as strong as ever.  In fact, I really can’t  think of a better time to be an Internet entrepreneur. The online  economy continues to out-grow the offline economy. If anything, that  growth gap is widening. Yet, without question these are challenging  times for anyone stuck on the wrong side of history."
11% growth per DAY?	17-Nov-10	"It has been a good week for theEpik Product Portal platform.  Design changes made during late-October are taking effect.  On Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday we have seen average DAILY growth of 19%, 8% and 6% in network revenues (a 3-day average of ~11%), breaking all previous daily records for the network. Probably even more impressive, the number of sites that are making money on a daily basis increased by 50% in the last 4 days.  Here is a brief overview of what is working.Scale what worksI sometimes say “scale what works”.   This is possible so long as you havedesigned for scale. Epik has done exactly that. So, when we find something that works, we scale it. This is why it is possible to have sustained periods of exponential growth as we saw over the summer.  The platform is performing well, and I believe we are heading into another leg of exponential growth — just in time for the holiday shopping spike.  Here is what I think is working with the Product Portals:Product Pages:  One of the major changes made in late October was the addition of product pages.  As expected, now these product pages are successfully getting indexed and ranking, which massively extends the number of keywords on which these sites can rank. More importantly, these sites are the substrate on which the new user-generated content can take shape.  We’ll also be extending it further withprice comparisoninformation. Eventually, we’ll integrate a directory of stores where individual products are for sale — a concept developed by Milo.com but which we think can be executed even better through integration ofDirectory Portaltechnology.Owner-driven editing:Owen Frager did agreat blog post todayabout Vishal Ithlani.   This is a must-read post for anyone serious aboutsustainable recurring income. Vishal is cracking the code for how to build on the product portals.  Morgan Schwartz,  Ian Lopuch and others have reported similar success. They have learned the back-end tools and are enhancing their sites and seeing near-instant lift with their site performance.  This is not rocket science.  The platform rocks. However, unlike domain parking,development is a process, not an event. Contact us if you would like to learn to use the back-end tools.  Alternatively, if you prefer to have it done for you, we can  help there too.Here is a quote from Ian Lopuch, reporting in after learning the back-end-tools:Check outPetiteJacket.net! I now have custom blurbs per page and 2 custom articles. I’m working through the rest of my sites and should be able to upload a few more tonight. Very excited and encouraged by the ease of use of your platform. It basically takes me half the time it would to upload a “custom” website that doesn’t look half as good.Bottom line – Product Portals work — Guaranteed!Product Portals remain the single best value for money for anyone looking to get started in domain development. And we are still theonlydomain development company that offers a one-year ROI performance guarantee on sites that are built on our product portal platform.Best of luck to Domain Developers. Whether you are building on Epik or not, the holiday shopping season is about to kick in and the environment for domain development has never been better. Domains can be acquired inexpensively, and there are now an abundance of tools available on which to develop income-producing websites.Let’s keep building!"
Amazon – Does the Goliath have an Achilles Heel?	12-Nov-10	"The recent launch ofEpik’s eCommerce platformhas prompted me to study eCommerce models very closely.  Any eCommerce strategy ultimately is not complete without a thoughtful discussion about the industry Goliath, Amazon.  I know that many people view Amazon as being invincible.  I will disagree and submit that their economic model is not well positioned and has been made more vulnerable by search-enabled price discovery.The Amazon Economic Model is vulnerableAlthough you would not guess it from the Amazon stock price, Amazon is financially challenged.Amazon’s balance sheetis not as strong as one would think.  While companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft have enormous warchests, Amazon’s warchest is relatively small.  The company has somewhere in the neighborhood of $5 billion in liquid assets versus current liabilities of about $6.3 billion.  With that type of liquidity ratio, I can’t imagine that it is a great time to besellingto Amazon.Amazon’s cash flow from operations is actuallynegativeon most days of the year:Net cash flow operations for the first 3 quarters of 2010 has been negative $1.93 billion.  Seasonally, Q4 is CRITICAL for Amazon. Q4 cashflowshouldoffset the first 3 quarters but if it doesn’t, thenext3 quarters are tough!  Contrast AMZN with Wal-Mart with consistently positive cash flow from operations of between $20 and $25 billion and far more seasonal consistency.Amazon’s margins are thin and will get thinner:  Under normal trading conditions, Amazon operates with gross margins in the range of 22%.  During Q3 2010, margins exploded to 31%, which appears to have come almost entirely from the supply chain.  That is consistent with anecdotal evidence that suppliers and affiliates have been substantially squeezed to the breaking point and are now starting to push back.The net of this is that I believe that the Goliath called Amazon is actually as vulnerable as ever.  Their core business is not producing a meaningful amount of cash flow so either shareholders are hugely believing in the promise of new products (Kindle…), or they believe that monopolistic margins can be achieved  in online sales in the future (unlikely).A Fight to the Death?Amazon’s core eCommerce busines is fighting a battle on at least three fronts:Traditional big-box retailers are getting adept at eCommerce:  Wal-Mart just laid down the gauntlet for the holidays with anaggressive program for free shipping. For anyone who regularly shops online, the prospect of free shipping on top of cheap prices on known brands, is pretty compelling.   As near as I can tell, Amazon’s one big advantage versus Wal-Mart is the absence of sales tax on much of what they ship. If that structural competitive advantage goes away … POOF.Niche retailers are moving online: Let’s face it, Googlehaschanged everything.  Price discovery is now instant because of search.  Long term, why would a consumer buy a product from an online super store, if the same product is available for the same price from an online store that services and supports what they sell with knowledgeable people?Margin compression in the value chain: The weak dollar is a challenge for the eCommerce value chain. It is only starting to show up inwholesalepricing. It will eventually show up inretailpricing. AProducer Price Indexat 4% annual increase does not yet reflect the surge in commodity prices since summer.  When it does — and I believe it will soon — the company with inventory (Wal-Mart) will have a structural advantage over the guy who does not (Amazon).Bottom line: Amazon is great, but they are vulnerableThe Amazon stock price is still priced for perfection.  It assumes continued topline growth and continued margin expansion.  My personal forecast is that Amazon will miss the analyst estimate for Q4 and then will have a horrible Q1 2011.  The buying spree with Zappos and Quidsi therefore make sense. Could this be the Amazon Empire executing a self-preservation strategy that improves the optics of sequential growth?  I think quite possibly yes.  Sure, Amazon has a lovely service. The company also employs wonderful people.  However, the economic conditions are creating margin pressure at a time when Amazon’s competitive advantages are eroding. And as for the Kindle as savior — fuggedaboutit — the iPad is going to crush it which is bad news for Amazon’s legacy business of selling books online.  The insiders see trouble brewing and areselling like crazy.Implications:  Anyone can take on Amazon and Everyone will!The Epik eCommerce platform allows anyone to build an eCommerce store.   How can you get started?Product Portals:  Epik has built more than 10,000 product portals in the last 10 months.  They are low cost, and are a flexible platform.  In addition to building and maintaining these good-looking sites, owners can add their own content through easy to use tools for enhancing each site.Hosted eCommerce:  Sites likeIceCreamMaker.comoften start out as a Product Portal. Once demand is verified, they become good looking eCommerce sites that achieve higher margins through actual product sales.  Epik partners with the domain owner to jointly operate the site and coaches the owner all the way through.Managed eCommerce:  For owners who want to own a full eCommerce venture like IceCreamMaker.com or EmergencyFood.com, but want nothing to do with daily operations, we also offer a Managed solution where all aspects of business operation are managed.  You own it. We run it.And so it is with great pleasure that I declare open season on Amazon.  You bring the vision. We’ll help you execute it! And Goliath — say hello to a thousand hungry, ambitious Davids. We have come to eat your lunch!"
Innovating in a land of Giants	9-Nov-10	"Recent news and developments are a reminder that we walk among Giants — and by this I do not mean the World Series Champion San Francisco Giants. I am talking about corporate behemoths likeAmazon,Apple,Google, andMicrosoftwhose treasuries are overflowing with cash and who are systematically reinforcing market dominance through a combination of methods.  And now, as expected, the biggest giant of them all, theUS Federal Reservehas added fuel to the monetary fire through a massive round of monetization.  How should internet entrepreneurs respond?But first – a word on GoogleAs has been extensively covered in the Domain industry blogosphere, a minority percentage of Epik Product Portals were removed from Google’s index 2 weeks ago.  Since that time, daily network traffic and revenues have fully recovered to their prior levels. Although there is still work to be done, sitesarebeing re-indexed — even withbetterrankings. Nevertheless, the de-indexing incident was a reminder of the degree to which many people in our industry believe that Google IS the Internet.Although I disagree with the broad characterization of Google as “judge,  jury and arbiter” about the merits of a site, I do agree that Developers have to take into consideration that if a business model has a primary long-term dependence on organic traffic from Google, this does come at a cost.  That cost can be measured in the form of compliance with Google’s Terms of Service, and/or can be measured in the form of investment in development of organic content and authoritative links.Search remains a significant source of traffic.  That said, we have always viewed search volumes and CPC prices as a useful indicator of a site’s potential rather than viewing traffic from search as being the end unto itself. By developing on keyword domains, we are giving consumers what they want and delivering it on a domain that is easy to remember. I believe the merits of this development strategy are 100% in tact, with or without an abundance of Google traffic — which we thankfully still have and appreciate.I would like to think the Epik Developer network for their enthusiastic support. This is a very unique group of individuals.  We kept the Developer network closely apprised about our findings, action plans and progress.  Rather than blog, I chose to do this entirely via email and phone. I am very pleased with the progress made and know that we did right by our Developers.  The Product Portal platform is stronger than ever and will continue to actively improved in parallel to the rollout of full eCommerce.We walk among GiantsThe Google incident caused me to step back and take a macro view of our strategy and operating environment. This happened to overlap with a planned 2 day visit last week to our Sandpoint, Idaho operations center for the purposes of working on the 2011 operating strategy and plan.  Although setbacks are never good, it helps when they occur right before key planning milestones.  So, here is the bottom line: in spite of very rapid growth, Epik —  and indeed the entire Domain industry — is still small relative to the Giants that dominate the Internet economy. A few more illustrative examples:The news this week ofDiapers.com parent company, Quidsi, being acquired for $540 million, is illustrative of the alchemy of great strategy, solid execution and a category-defining domain name.  What was not broadly reported is that Amazon allegedly undercut Diapers.com via a price war that ultimately served to bomb Quidsi to the bargaining table. I for one believe that Quidsi, in time, like Zappos before it, would have been a material threat to Amazon.Apple Computer, Microsoft and Google areswimming in cashwith liquidity hoards, of $51 billion, $44 billion and $33 billion respectively.  These are enormous sums, particularly when compared to something as small as the Domain industry.  These are also enormous sum in terms of the implied ability to acquire small operating companies that represent a future threat to these would-be monopolists.Yet, as impressive as these balance sheets are, these companies store the vast majority of their wealth in the form of a currency that is being rapidly debased by the US Federal Reserve, who,as predicted, launched QE2, the next phase of central bank monetization.  The official number of $600billionis just another tranche of money-for-nothing that are systematically debasing the world’s main reserve currency.  That is more than all of the profits of the Fortune 500 —combined. Gotcha!The Implications for Domain Investors and Internet EntrepreneursSo, what does this mean for Domain Investors and Internet Entrepreneurs?  Since I have been right about a number of other predictions over the past year, I will offer two more:Here comes the next wave of Corporate M&A:   The single biggest issue for US monetary policy has been the absence ofmonetary velocity.  In response, I believe the Fed has decided to play chicken with anyone that chooses to keep idle cash on the sidelines.  Commodity prices are telegraphing in no uncertain terms:inflation is here.  Whether or not that translates into hyperinflation is subject of debate.  There are plenty of smart people that still believe that the Fed can put the inflation genie back in the bottle before it is too late. In the meantime, the message from the Federal Reserve is very clear to holders of cash:use it or lose it.  I expect corporate executive teams will have a mandate to put their warchests to work – ASAP.  The near-term result will almost certainly be that the Giants will become more giant.The Dollar as reserve currency is toast: Whether by design or by incompetence, The Federal Reserve has crossed the Rubicon.  The Federal Reserve’s mandate is to preserve the integrity of the currency yet is now openly debasing the world’s main reserve fiat currency. Even inflation-protected TIPS are not a counter-measure against monetization since (1) the CPI index has little to no correlation to real world inflation, and (2) proceeds are payable in US Dollars. Gotcha! The rocketing prices of precious metals — and the retail scarcity of actual physical metal — are a clear indicator that the monetization bluff is being called.  Where this ends up nobody knows, but, tragically, I don’t see a happy ending for the US Dollar as reserve currency.The bottom line for Internet entrepreneurs:  Although these are perilous economic times, I know of no better investment strategy than a diversified and capital-efficient portfolio of income-producing websites that can be operated from anywhere, and sold to anyone, either stand-alone, or as a portfolio.The bottom line for Epik:  Epik’s model isalready proven: we are building online businesses.  What makes Epik trulyspecialis that these businesses are leveraging aunified architecturethat aligns the interests of a network of Development Partners in building an Internet that we believe will bebetterthan the one that preceded it.Onwards!Sincerely,Robert W.

Is November 3 the planned kick-off day for QE2?	24-Oct-10	"There was aninteresting read on ZeroHedgea few weeks ago. The article made the case for announcement of a $3 trillion wave of Quantitative Easing starting on November 3 — the day after the US mid-term elections, and also the date of the next meeting of the Federal Reserve Board Governors. Since this provocative article was published, other estimates for “QE2” have been as high as$4 trillionand even$7 trillion. In other words, the public policy debate appears to no longer be about “whether“, but now entirely about “how much“. Shocking.Here is the distilled digest:Quantitative Easing is where the Federal Reserve buys the debt of a central bank.  However, when banks can borrow money at zero percent, and there is still insufficient liquidity in the economy to foment sustained economic growth, Plan B is to inject even more liquidity, only this time the theory is that a large portion of the money will go right into buying assets, e.g. equities in publicly traded companies, as some believe has recently been the case.In theory, the stock market goes up. As a result, people feel wealthier and spend more. In the process, the increase in nominal income also gets taxed which is good for under-reserved state and federal coffers that have seen their tax base get hit hard since 2008.  The risk with this strategy is that the world calls into question the integrity of the US dollar as reserve currency.  After all, Zimbabwe has had the best performing stock market in 2010 but unfortunately the Zim dollar is effectively worthless.To be clear, the US is no Zimbabwe. The comparison is relative, not absolute.  However, even so, the risk of holding large amounts of currency-based savings would rise considerably if QE2 is activated on the indicated scale.  For calibration, here is one visual rendering of what a $3 trillion Quantitative Easing might look like in terms of the Fed’s balance sheet:Sooner or later, something has got to give. There are two major schools of economic thought on stimulus.  Someone once summarized them this way:Keynesian economics= over the long-term, everyone can have a free lunch.Austrian economics= over the long-term, there are no free lunches.I personally subscribe to the latter view and believe that deficits do matter and that 40 million people on welfare and 17%U6 unemploymentis a train wreck.  The great global reset is coming one way or another.So what exactly are we stimulating anyway?Last week, the Daily Beast conducted theirInnovators Summit.  There was a panel discussion with economist-journalist Niall Ferguson where the panelists discussed the implications of fiscal and monetary stimulus. Here is a salient clip:The gist is this: in a global economy, QE2 will not only stimulate the US economy, but rather capital flows will be felt all over the world and would be likely to manifest themselves in emerging economies and rising prices for commodities.  I could not agree more.The G-20 meeting did not exactly end in harmonyOne important development to watch has been the G20 discussions.  In the meantime, the G20 meetings in South Korea wrapped up over the weekend and published acommunique.  Read literally, one would conclude that there is consensus and that the central bankers are in alignment on the game plan.  Unfortunately, coming out of the G20, there isone quote from German Finance Minister Rainer Bruderle, that seems to suggest polar opposite views on the merits of QE2:“I tried to make clear that I regard that (QE-2) as the wrong way to go. An excessive, permanent increase in money is, in my view, an indirect manipulation of the exchange rate.”The UK and Germany appear to have opted for the path of austerity and fiscal control. France is on a similar trajectory in spite ofmassive strikes.  The US, by contrast, appears to be heading in the opposite direction.Implications for Domain InvestorsIn summary here is where I think we stand:The stage is being set for QE2 — probably right after the mid-term elections. It may involve trillions of dollars in newly-minted currency — backed by nothing and borrowed from the Federal Reserve.  Austerity could likely still save the US Dollar but this does not appear to the chosen path of US policy makers.If QE2 is launched, the fuse would be lit. Inflation would come back with a vengeance as speculators and emerging markets secure real assets.  In this case, the dollar — which is already down sharply — gets hammered.  Watch agricultural prices, oil prices and precious metals prices for clues.QE2 will almost inevitably stimulate theInternet economy. I strongly believe that in this next phase of global economic integration, the Internet will become more important not less important, and national boundaries will become less important not more important.And while here is no perfect hedge for the risks associated with US policy-makers executing QE2, I remain convinced thatdevelopment-grade domain names are a logical store of wealthcomparable to physical precious metals and other commodities that are sufficiently rare and finite, that no amount of currency printing will dramatically reduce theirrelativevalue ."
SwapFest-Miami – Update	24-Oct-10	"As expected, SwapFest-Miami was bigger and better. The participants in SwapFest-Miami came away with a nice haul.  The list of winning bids can be downloadedhere.  SwapFest is now open for public bidding for the remaining inventory.  Bids will be accepted through Wednesday, 10/27 at 5 pm PT and announced by Friday, 10/29.  In this phase of SwapFest-Miami, thehighestvalid bid will be accepted.Dutch Auction in ReviewThe SwapFest Dutch auction format was eye-opening for the first-time participants last Wednesday in Miami.  Within 75 minutes, SwapFest auctioned off nearly 5,000 domains with websites.  Unlike conventional auctions where one domain is auctioned off at a time, in SwapFest, all domains are auctioned simultaneously using a declining price schedule. For the uninitiated, this was something new.  For the experienced participants, it was open season.   The result was a record number of domains sold for a record level of SwapFest revenue.  Each domain sold includes a website which Epik continues to host at no additional cost to the new owner.SwapFest RecapSwapFest Miami started with a brief overview of Epik and a primer on the SwapFest auction format.  For anyone who missed SwapFest, the Slideshow for SwapFest-Miami was uploaded to Slideshow.com.  You can see it here:Congratulations to the winning bidders in SwapFest-Live. We’ll post the results of SwapFest-Extended on 10/27.Many thanks toTRAFFICfor their cooperation in making SwapFest part of TRAFFIC Miami.  Plans are under way to conduct another SwapFest as part of the program for TRAFFIC San Francisco in March immediately prior to ICANN Meeting 40."
Bidding at SwapFest — here is how it will look	18-Oct-10	"The pre-bids continue to roll in forSwapFest-Miamion 10/20.  As of Monday evening,Pre-bidsfor SwapFest-Miami already exceed thetotalbids for SwapFest-Seattle.  Since the SwapFest Dutch auction bidding format will be new for most of the participants, this blog post will provide a brief overview of how the bidding works for anyone who plans to participate on-site orpre-bid remotely.How does a Dutch auction work?A Dutch auction is an ideal format for selling large amounts of inventory.  In a regular auction, each auction lot is individually auctioned. By contrast, in a Dutch auction, many lots can be auctioned at the same price.  Bid prices start on the high end of the expected range and then fall to a final reserve price. At each bid price, SwapFest participants have the opportunity to submit a bid sheet which lists lot numbers that are of interest. Thefirstvalid bid for a given lot numbers wins.  And since there is no bidder-to-bidder competitive haggling, Dutch auctions are extremely efficient. This is why we expect to auction off more than 5,000 lots in the span of just 90 minutes.  For anyone who has never seen a Dutch auction, stop by on Wednesday morning atTRAFFIC in South Beachto see the action.Auction Bid Prices for SwapFest-MiamiAll SwapFest participants will have received aSwapBookwhich includes the list of assets available for bidding.  In addition, all participants receive Bid sheets which are distributed ahead of the start of SwapFest.   On the bid sheet, bidders selectoneprice point from the below list of bid levels.  Each Bid sheet can include as many lots as can fit on the page.  Here are the bidding levels:$9,999    $8,999    $7,999    $6,999    $5,999    $4,999    $3,999    $2,999    $1,999$1,899    $1,799    $1,699    $1,599    $1,499    $1,399    $1,299    $1,199    $1,099$999    $899    $799    $699    $649     $599    $549    $499    $449$399    $389    $379    $369    $359    $349    $339    $329    $309$299    $289    $279    $269    $259    $258    $257    $256    $255$254    $253    $252    $251    $250    $249Click here to download a sample SwapFest-Bid-SheetIf you wish toPre-bid remotely, you can(1)fill in the online form, or (2) send a completed Bid sheet to swap@epik.com by 5 pm ET on Tuesday, 10/19. All pre-bids are confidential.Suggested bidding strategy for a SwapFest Auction – High, Middle LowTo do well in a Dutch auction, it pays to do your homework, and have a strategy. The strategy that I believe works best is a “High, Middle, Low” strategy.  Let’s say a participant wants to bid on 30 different lots.  Of the 30 lots, the bidder has 5 lots that he/she definitely does not want to miss, 10 lots that he/she would really like, and 15 lots that are nice to have.  In this case, the bidder prepares 3 bid sheets.  The price at which the bidder intends to submit the 3 bids might be left unspecified in order to get a sense of the bidding pace.  At the moment that the bidder wants to bid, the bidder circles the appropriate bid price and hands in the bid sheet corresponding to the price at which the bidder wants to bid. Unless you are an aggressive bidder, odds are good that you will only win a fraction of your submitted bids. However by using High, Middle, Low, your odds increase for winning the names that matters most to you.Remember — All lots at SwapFestincludea developed websiteIt is important to keep in mind that each auction lot at SwapFest, includes the development cost of the custom website.  In other words, the typical development cost of $249 for a Product Portal has beenincludedin the bid price.  While bidders are not obligated to use the developed site, we hope you will try it out for as long as possible.  Post-SwapFest, each domain is transferred to the winning bidders. If the associated website is not yet live, it will be completed shortly after SwapFest at no additional cost.  For any websites that are live, in most cases, you are able to see current site statistics by adding /stats to websites of interest, e.g. bra.net/stats.  It is also a good idea to check the indexing and ranking status of any sites of interest."
Pre-bidding is active for SwapFest-Miami	16-Oct-10	"The weather in Miami isperfectand the pre-bidding for SwapFest is heating up.  One bidder has already submitted more than 100 pre-bids.  With morethan 5,000 auction lotsin this SwapFest, there is something for everyone.  Whether you are attendingSwapFest-Miamior not, Pre-bidding for SwapFest is a good strategy. Here is why.Pre-bidding can be done remotely:   Unlike SwapFest.com #1 which was restricted for DevCon participants only, SwapFest #2 allows for remote pre-bids.   For Developers on a budget, Pre-bidding is the way to go.Pre-Bids get Priority over Live Bids:  At each bidding cycle, the Pre-bids get processed first. For example, if the bidding is at $500 in the Dutch auction countdown, and there are multiple room bidders with bids, the pre-bids will take priority.   For anyone who observed a photo-finish at SwapFest #1, it is easy to see why a Pre-Bid would be a wise strategy.Pre-Bids are Confidential:  The risk with pre-bidding would be if others knew your pre-bids. SwapFest has a strict privacy process — only Luke Webster and I know the pre-bids right up until the start of SwapFest Live.  We may share how many pre-bids have been received intotalbutnotwhat domain, who bid or for how much.Pre-Bids are Strategic:  With more than 5,000 assets up for bid, it will pay to do your homework and map out bidding targets before the action begins.  While nobody is likely to win all of their pre-bids, pre-bidding means you won’t forget to bid when the action begins.For anyone in Miami, stop by the SwapFest cabana to learn more about SwapFest and Epik. For anyone not in Miami, we’ll keep blogging about latest SwapFest news and answering popular questions about SwapFest."
SwapFest.com launched. SwapFest-Miami is ON!	14-Oct-10	"The first SwapFest in Seattle was a surprise hit.  The efficient Dutch auction model made it possible to auction more than 3,000 domain assets in less than 90 minutes using an auction format that is fun and transparent.  The idea of SwapFest was big enough to justify developing a business around it.  To this end, I am pleased thatSwapFest.comis now live and that theSwapBook for SwapFest Miami is available for download.SwapFest Miami is set for October 20 at the Loews Beach Hotel starting at 9 amSwapFest will be on the morning of October 20, capping the TRAFFIC Miami conference.  SwapFest is free to attend.  Here are the main dates leading up to SwapFest-MiamiFriday, October 15 – Pre-bidding beginsSaturday, October 16  – Visit theSwapFest Hospitality Cabanaat TRAFFIC to pick up a SwapBook.Tuesday, October 19 – Pre-bidding endsWednesday, October 20 – SwapFest starts at 9 am with breakfastMany thanks to the TRAFFIC team for allowing SwapFest to run concurrently to TRAFFIC.  Luke Webster, Kristine Oliver, Cliff Beer and I will be on hand from the Epik team, including an exhibit during TRAFFIC. We invite TRAFFIC attendees to find out more about SwapFest as well as about working with Epik.What is different about SwapFest Miami?Like most things, we hope to improve with each iteration.  SwapFest #2 in Miami is bigger and better.  Here is what is different:Bigger inventory:  This SwapFest will include more than 5,000 listings.  The listings include more aged domains both from acquired portfolios and from Epik’s own holdings.Premium listings:  This SwapFest also includes a small number of premium listings with low reserves.  The vast majority of the listings have a $249 reserve for a domain namewitha website.Pre-Bidding: At SwapFest #1, we often had simultaneous bids arrive. This created some risk that multiple bidders would bid for the same listing at the same price and be subject to luck of the draw as to whose bid sheet was received first.  While somewhat hilarious, it was not scientific. Pre-bidding is a partial solution.Remote Bidding: At SwapFest #1, you had to be on site in order to participate.  A lot of people felt like they had missed out by not participating.  For people who think that the cost of a flight and hotel are better spent on buying domains, this is good news.We have a few more innovations we are working on to make this a SwapFest to remember.  We hope to see you there!"

Epik ships full eCommerce – The next chapter begins	10-Oct-10	"At the September Epik Developer Conference, we announced that Epik would be shipping full eCommerce in Q4.  Well, I am delighted to announce that the first eCommerce portal to go live isEmergencyFood.com.   The platform is officiallylaunchedand we believe that this is the single largest leap forward in capability since the start of shipping for Product Portals just one year ago. With more than8,000 Epik Stores already live, the future is brighter than ever.The Epik solution for Full eCommerce is a robust and feature-rich. It provides support for orders, shipping, billing, returns, discounts. It is also designed for flexible commerce, combining sales from inventory, dropship and affiliate all in one integrated portal with expanded content and graphics.  Each eCommerce portal also comes withcentralized customer service and logistics from Epik Operations center in Sandpoint, Idaho.Full eCommerce is a large step forwardSo why did we not start with full eCommerce in the first place?  When we first set out to build “Federated Amazon”, we knew that it would be possible to do full eCommerce across 100,000 product categories. However, the execution risks of such a strategy would be enormous.  Affiliate stores offer a cost-effective and low-risk path to verify demand and determine which specific products sell well, and have good prospects to continue to sell well.   However, it takes a while to build serious profits at 18 cents a click.  What we sacrificed in short-term upside was more than offset by controlling short-term execution risk.  We now know which products sell, and can now intelligently direct a sourcing and fulfillment strategy for those products.  Also, Developers can now make intelligent choices about which Portals to sell versus which ones to Develop into Full eCommerce.Sourcing Products and Shipping OrdersOne of the largest new tasks when building eCommerce portals is managing product sourcing. This is a large part of what Epik commits to do when we take on a new eCommerce portal.  For example, with EmergencyFood.com we have secured dropship relationships with many vendors which allows for competitive pricing with worthwhile margins.  Epik will alsoinventorysome products where the margins are sufficiently high to accept inventory risk.  The question of inventory versus no-inventory is fundamentally a question of risk-adjusted return. What we have found is that the process for securing products is dramatically shortened by already having a site that is live, ranked highly on organic search and receiving meaningful traffic. In many cases, the vendors actually come to us, particularly Chinese exporters.  We have established a dedicated department in our Sandpoint, Idaho operations center, led by eCommerce veteran Troy DuBose,  that is focused on supplier management.  Our initial focus is on dropshipping, however we expect to begin warehousing products by Q1 2011.  Epik Operations Center is a block a away from the operations center of online clothing retailer Coldwater Creek. There is an abundance of warehouse space in Sandpoint, with good proximity to major shipping corridors, in particular, railroads, but also interstate highways.Affiliate or eCommerce — which ones is right for you?At Epik, we now have more than8,000 product portals live.In the next 12 months, we expect this to grow to between 50,000 and 100,000 stores.Why?  Our analysis has indicated that there are approximately 100,000 unique product categories that are sufficiently large to justify having a dedicated online retail presence.  If you have a great product category name, the operative question will be whether to start with affiliate-only or make the leap to full eCommerce. That decision is largely a financial decision. The cost of an affiliate store costs just $249 as a one-time setup fee with no additional investment required.  The setup cost of full eCommerce is $2500 with much of this cost related to managing development of the supply chain.   If you have previously invested in an affiliate store, Epik deducts this prior cost.  As such, in most cases, it will make sense to start with affiliate and upgrade to full eCommerce once some base level of traffic has been achieved.Try EmergencyFood.com today and save 15%.These are unusual times that we live in.  If you or your family has been slow to implement a Disaster Preparation plan, now might be a good time to work on that.  For the month of October,shop at EmergencyFood.com and save 15%with the promotional codeepik.   Feel free to send us any feedback on your shopping experience by contacting Sean Hayes, President of EmergencyFood.com at sean@emergencyfood.com.Plan for an Epik store of your own!An eCommerce store is a larger undertaking than an affiliate store. As such, it requires more planning and thought.  Not only do we need a great domain name with traffic, but  we also recommend focusing on a category that resonates with your personal interests and goals. As the business grows, there will be more decisions around which inventory to carry, which brands to carry, etc.  To get a fuller appreciation of the opportunities in eCommerce, I recommend spending a few hours on an international trading site likeAliBaba.com.  You may be surprised to find the large gaps between what you can expect to pay for a product at your favorite online retail store and what the cost of that same product is when sourced from the manufacturer in bulk. That is a great way to identify category opportunities where significant profit opportunities may exist as eCommerce becomes more federated and as manufacturers seek a more direct relationship with their end-customers as we are certain is about to happen in the next phase of eCommerce.   The Epik Store platform is in the right place, at the right time at the right price."
What happens when Domains become accepted as an asset class?	4-Oct-10	"The theme ofDomain Names as an investment asset classwas covered at length in theopening presentation at Epik DevConlast month.  It also led to some good discussions, offline and online.  What I think many Domain Investors don’t fully comprehend is the notion of a “tipping point”, i.e. when suddenly, a generation of institutional investors wake up to theunbeatable combination of attributesthat make the Domain Name Asset Class so darned interesting to investors.As Alternative Investments go, Premium Domain Names are a lot like Rare Earth MetalsA good case study of a “tipping point” in asset pricing can be found in what happened in Q3 2010 to the prices ofRare Earth Metals.  I am not talking about Precious Metals like Gold and Silver, which have also rocketed higher. I am talking about things you may well have never even heard of likeLanthanum,Cerium,Neodymium,PraseodymiumandSamarium.  Prices exploded 250 to 600% during July to September 2010.  Here is a representative price chart:And while you may not have read about this blatant sign of price inflation in USA Today, ZeroHedge.com did a nice piece on it earlier today which you can readhere.  The point here is that investors identified an inefficient market where there is finite supply and then secured a large enough market position to presumably cause (1) a wave of short-covering, and (2) a follow-on wave of speculation. I expect we will see a lot more of this type of price spike in the months ahead as investors move cash off of the sidelines ahead of what appears to be imminentQuantitative Easing 2.0.Dollars are seeking alternative investment vehiclesAt Epik we have been making the case for some time why Domains are better than Dollars.   We said it inNovember 2009,February 2010, and more recently.   Quality domains, — like precious metals — are rare. Back in November, Gold was $1,000 an ounce (now ~$1320). Silver was $16 an ounce (now $22).  If this is a reasonable indication of the decline in purchasing power of the US Dollar — as well as paper currencies in general — it is reasonable to infer that we are at a tipping point for other alternative assets.The tension around wealth preservation is building. Consider the FDIC’s announcement on September 27 of extendingunlimited coverage on checking depositsas if increasing from $100K to $250K was not enough.  Personally, I don’t think there is much question that the FDIC will make good on insured deposits. The question ishow much willyour Dollars  beworthwhen they do?The same logic applies to other national insurance programs that stand behind bank deposits.Is there a safe Paper Currency?Many people use DXY as an indicator of dollar value. I would argue thatDXYis a lousy indicator of currency value. Why? DXY compares paper currencies to other paper currencies. If all major central banks are in a competitive process of debasing their currencies, therelativevalue of the currencies will not move decisively.  What moves instead is theabsolutepurchasing power. And for this we have commodities against which to measure the trend.  Precious and Rare Metals are as good a benchmark as any.So, my conclusion is that although we do need Paper Currency as a medium of exchange to manage the household budget,the case for Paper currency as a store of wealth is rapidly weakening. Retail banks are lobbying the consumer to put cash on deposit at a time when the consumer should be seriously considering the opposite. And while quality domains are not a perfect hedge — there is no such thing — Domains have much to offer as a store of wealth as well as a prospective source of yield and capital gain.Asset Allocation – How much exposure to the Domain Name Asset Class?By no means would I recommend to someone put all of their liquid net worth into Domain Names.  However, somewherebetween 10% and 50%makes sense so long asno single domain holding is more than 5% of that total allocation. I would say,consult your investment advisor, but they would almost certainly just give you a blank stare and offer you a lovely mutual fund or 1% interest-bearing money market fund.  That would be your clue that it is time to get a different investment advisor."
How to turn a Cease & Desist into a Domain Buyer	4-Oct-10	"Epik recently sold a domain name (www.nighttherapy.com) to a party who held a registered trademark to “Night Therapy.”   While not a windfall, the $7,500 selling price was still more than 100X of our cost basis in 2005 when we picked it up on the drop.  I asked Cliff Beer, Epik’s General Counsel, to comment on how we handled the situation of responding to aCease and Desistthat we concluded to bewithout groundsand were prepared to defend vigorously.Brief Summary of the NightTherapy.com case – as summarized by Cliff BeerEpik had owned and actively operated a site in a commercial manner stretching back to 2005.  The buyer/Trademark-holder registered the Trademark in 2008 and actively used the Trademark in business from that time forward to sell various products.  The scope of Epik’s preceding use of the phrase “nighttherapy” included affiliate sales of products within the same category of products to which the TM holder had subsequently registered.Through the active use of the nighttherapy.com site from 2005 forward, Epik established defendable rights to use of both the domain name itself, and the mark “nighttherapy” as against the subsequent TM registrant.  It’s a common misconception that a TM registrant has exclusive and absolute rights to use of the TM in all instances and in all jurisdictions – this is simply not the case.In most jurisdictions, where one’s use of the mark — embodied within an active domain name, for example — pre-dates the subsequent TM registrant’s use, the original user possesses defendable rights to continued use within the scope of original use, provided such use is reasonably continuous, i.e. not “abandoned”. Refer to theWooly Bulland Ashton v Harleecases for more.For the domain owner to have a solid footing here, he or she needs to have an active site utilizing the mark contained within the domain address in a real and substantive manner, and on a continuous basis.  Epik had continuously used thewww.nighttherapy.comdomain by way of a very basic site providing affiliate product sales – a site for which we typically charge clients $249 to set up.The TM holder’s attorney recognized this active and continuous use, knew he couldn’t fleece the domain owner with a threatening Demand Letter. Instead of pursuing a fruitless legal path, he simply got on with the business of paying a respectable price for the domain.  By contrast, parking would not have been considered a defendable use of the mark here.  A domain owner that parks a domain is at much greater risk of losing rights as against a subsequent TM registrant.Finding a good Domain AttorneyReaders should check with TM laws in effect in their geography and, where necessary, seek advice of counsel knowledgeable in that jurisdiction.  I can personally recommendHoward Neu,John Berryhill,Karen Bernstein, plus our very own,Cliff Beer.If you need legal advice and are short on cash, you can pay Cliff inEpikBucks.  We’ll be working on the other Domain Attorneys to do the same!"
How folks are building wealth on Epik – 6 case studies	30-Sep-10	"It is always interesting to me to see how folks are building their development portfolios on Epik.  There are different strategies that are working for different people in terms of how they are building value.  This post spotlights a few individuals and their strategies.The Empire Builder – Kenny HartogKenny is the largest developer on Epik. As such, he needs no introduction.  Kenny’s strategy has to been to build out mainly long-tail names that are hand-registered.  In addition, Kenny owns some top-ranked sites likeIceCreamMaker.com.  Since starting with Epik in January,  Kenny has assembled a portfolio of more than 1,000  sites, comprised mostly of hand-registered names, including many hyphenated exact match names. Because of the size of his monthly payout, Kenny is also fast-approaching our highest revenue share rate (80%) which makes it attractive for him to acquire portfolios of other people that are starting at 50% revenue share.  One of Kenny’s preferred methods for funding development is buyingEpikBucksfrom other people at 85-90 cents on the dollar and then using these EpikBucks to acquire domains (e.g. at SwapFest) or fund new developments.The Merchant – Oliver HogerThose who know Oliver Hoger, know that he is a merchant. He loves the deal. Since partnering with Epik, he has been aggressively acquiring high quality .net names likePolice.netandToilet.netand entering into co-development agreements with Epik whereby we waive setup fees in exchange for 30% of the proceeds from eventual sale of the developed website.  In a very short time, Oliver has partnered with Epik on more than 100 domains.  He is one of the most active buyers that I know, notably of .net domains, which we have proven are just as easy to rank as the .com names. Most of Oliver’s sites have gone online during September. Earlier this month, he soldComputerTips.comat the Epik-Moniker live auction for $17,500.  I think odds are good that by November, Oliver will be giving Kenny a run for his money on daily revenue.The Stager – Morgan SchwartzMorgan is a teacher by day.  At night and on the weekends, he backorders names and develops them on Epik.  Over the summer, Morgan got trained in how to build sites on Epik.  Morgan is also one of the first to sell his developed sites at the Moniker Live Auction.  Here are a few of his exits so far:BoughtBeachBags.neton 6/10 for $249 –  sold on 9/17 for $2500 (900% return)BoughtExerciseMat.neton 6/24 for $249  – sold on 9/17 for $1200 (381% return)BoughtCamcorderMicrophones.comon 4/25 for $249 – sold on 9/17 for $2000 (700% return)BoughtClothingRack.neton  4/29 for $249 – sold on 9/17 for $1000  (300% return)In the meantime, these sites were already making money from operating revenue.  Morgan is a great example of a Developer who adds value and exits while leaving plenty of upside on the table for the next guy.  In the real estate terms, he would be what the industry calls a “Stager”, ie. improves the property but then promptly sells it.The Gardener – Todd JohnsonTodd is one of the most humble guys I know in the domain world.  However, don’t let the humility fool you.  Todd is all business.  He is the original member of what I have come to call theAlbuquerque Epik Mafia.  Todd has assembled a portfolio of high performing sites that make money. Examples:CamoBedding.com– #1 on Google – Makes $210/monthHomeComputerDesk.com– #1 on Google – Makes $52/monthManPurse.net– #1 on Google – Makes $180/monthBicycleKickstand.com– #1 on Google – Makes $34/monthTodd applies best practices for site development and adds value to them through content sourcing and link-development on top of what Epik provides.  Unlike Morgan Schwartz, Toddrarelysells. He would sooner give a name for free than sell.  Todd’s methodical approach is generating solid recurring income that has brought him into the top-10 for monthly income but with much less total capital employed relative to the approaches of Kenny or Oliver.The Prospector – Aaron WilkensonAaron is on track to finish 2010 with more than 100 live portals on Epik.  He assembled this portfolio with relatively little cash employed.  His method has been to acquire or hand-register the types of domains that Epik likes to develop.  Epik in turn acquired these names from Aaron for EpikBucks which he then used at SwapFest, or used to development of his own high potential domains. If you look at theresults from the Epik SwapFestyou can see that Aaron did rather well. Aaron picked up 47 domains with websites. The amazing thing is that he has been able to build his portfolio with almost no cash invested. I just smile when I look back at how he managed to do this in a very short time with a relatively modest investment.  Aaron is doing great and is going to be a Developer to Watch in 2011.The Bandit – Braden PollockBraden is perhaps best known for building one of the most complete portfolios of legal domain names — something that he has been doing on Epik’sDevRich.complatform. I call Braden the$219 Banditbecause if you look at the results fromEpik SwapFest #1, you will see that all of his bids were at $219.   He had prepared a bid sheet at near the lowest price in the Dutch auction, and while most of his picks were already gone, he managed to capture some great properties for $219 each.  In addition to cleaning up at SwapFest #1, Braden is one of the most disciplined domainers that I know. He methodically maps out his targets and pays exactly the price he ways to pay.  While he won’t get every name he wants, he is able to consolidate positions in target markets.   This is similar to a strategy used by Graham Easton of Singapore-based SwiftRank which now has 30,000 live sites in the hotel vertical.  Like a thief in the night, these guys are monopolizing the name space in entire verticals.What’s your strategy?As you can see, there are many strategies that work. The strategies that work best are the ones that fit individual personalities and interests.   The Developers profiled in this post are having fun, adding value, and improving the internet by taking parked or unregistered domains and making them into online businesses.   This is a small sampling of some of the success stories that are taking shape.  Look for more case studies in the months ahead."
Pay for TRAFFIC with EpikBucks – Offer expires on September 30	25-Sep-10	"We always knew that Rick Schwartz and Howard Neu had vision.  So, when we asked them if they would be open to the idea of accepting EpikBucks as a form of payment for the upcomingTRAFFIC conference in Miami, it was no surprise that they wholeheartedly embraced the idea.TRAFFIC is a franchise worth preservingIn recent years, attendance at TRAFFIC has dropped off, in part because the cost of the event became prohibitive for all the most successful domain investors.  Other conferences filled the gap with lower cost short-format programs.  However, for networking with the power players, TRAFFIC is still the venue of choice.  Attracting a new generation of domain investor is part of what will keep the TRAFFIC event worthwhile.  At the same time, a modicum of creativity will help out those individuals who are what I callLong on Domains, Short on Cash.  That is where EpikBucks can play a role.Paying for TRAFFIC with EpikBucksTRAFFIC has generously agreed to an arrangement which will allow conference attendees to pay for their conference attendance using EpikBucks.This offer expires on Thursday, September 30, so act now.  To take advantage of this offer, here are the steps:Submit names for review by the Epik SwapFest team.   To do so, just send your list of eligible names to swap@epik.comUpon review, we’ll confirm a valuation in EpikBucks.  Please allow up to 48 hours for an estimate.Once an EpikBucks offer is accepted, you will transfer your selected names to Epik. Your EpikBucks account is credited.You can now use your EpikBucks.  Confirm your TRAFFIC registration by 9/30 to pay with your EpikBucks.We are delighted to see the EpikBucks currency emerge as an industry currency. In an economic environment where conventional cash remains tight for many industry participants, I believe there could be a vast range of ways in which this alternative currency can get things moving again.  The early indications have beengreat.SwapFest Miami will be open to the publicThe upcoming SwapFest in Miami will be the second time we run a SwapFest.  It will be on the morning of October 20.   For folks who absolutely cannot swing the TRAFFIC budget for the 4-day extravaganza but still want to participate, there is good news.  Access to the on-site SwapFest event will be open to the public.If you wish to submit names for the upcoming SwapFest, send them to swap@epik.com.  Here is the timetable:SwapFest #1Public bid cycle ends – Thursday, September 30, 5 pm PT  – submit bids to swap@epik.comWinning bids confirmed – Friday, October 1.SwapFest #2Domain submission cycle ends –  Friday, October 14, 5 pm PTSwapBook published – October 15SwapFest for on-site participants only – October 20 10 amStart of Public bidding – October 22End of Public bidding – October 29, 5 pm"
"If you think the stock market is rallying, I have news"	24-Sep-10	"The stock market is having an up week. Or is it?  Normalized for purchasing power, it is flat in the short-term and down sharply in the intermediate term. The Dow-Gold ratio provides a truer indicator of the health of the stock market.  And that indicator is flashing red.   Take a look.Long-term Dow-Gold is in a secular bear marketDenominated in gold, the stock market has been in a SUSTAINED bear market since 2000. Surprised?  Take a look at the chart below and you will see that the DJIA never rallied meaningfully since the 2001 crash.  The ratio has fallen from a high of 43.7 to currently about 8.So what about this week?The DJIA popped above 10,800 today. Feels like a rally, right? Wrong.   Normalized for purchasing power, the DJIA is at best holding parity.   The trend to a Dow-Gold ofas low as 1 or 2remains completely in tact as the Dow-Gold ratio hugs the 50-day moving average as you can see below.  If the 50-day MA crosses the 200-day MA, I would reconsider. However until then, this looks like a secular bear market with more downside than upside of owning stocks.Hedge YourselfOn Monday, 9/27, I would expect a volatile day. Why? Monday is expiration day for options, notably options on precious metals which have moved decisively higher in the last month.  Financial institutions that are materially on the short side of the trade will either have to engineer a pullback by Monday close of trading or settle a large tab. Stay tuned.For an indicator of whether fiat currencies or real assets are winning, I would use silver bullion price as an indicator. It is harder to manipulate because it is an industrial metal and not substantially held in physical form by any central bank.  And earlier this week, it just punched through to a 10 year high.To see a higher number, you have to go all the way to 1980 when theHunt Brothers attempted to corner the silver market.At the Epik DevCon last week, I devoted an entire section toDomain Names as Asset Classin my opening presentation.  The slides for that talk appear on Slideshow.com. You can view themhere."

bidding format that allowed a large amount of inventory to be auctioned off.   It was also a lot of fun as anyone who was there will attest if they have not already.What happens next?Here is what is going on now:Settlement: The domains are being pushed to the winning bidders and Epik accounts are being updated so that the winning bidders accrue revenue for the month of September.Public bidding: The on-site SwapFest participants had the first bite of the apple. Now the inventory is open to the public for bidding.  Keep in mind that the minimum bid on any asset is $299 for a domain with a website.  You can download the inventory here:Final Booklet – SwapFest.Close of Public bidding:  The public bidding cycle will end on September 30 at 5 pm PT. To submit a bid, send the list of domains with prices to swap@epik.com.  All bids are for domains with an Epik-powered website.   Winning bidders will own the names and are free to resell them.Next SwapFest – Miami on October 20, 2010Rick Schwartz and Howard Neu have graciously allowed Epik to run another SwapFest as add-on to theTRAFFIC Conference in Miami.   Luke Webster, Kristine Oliver and I will be on hand at the conference.   Details of Swapfest #2 will be announced soon.  As prework for anyone intending to participate in SwapFest #2, we recommend sending in domains that you wish to convert to EpikBucks.  You can do so by sending portfolios toswap@epik.comand we’ll review them."
Extended Auction – A guided tour of the featured listings	20-Sep-10	"The Extended auction for the Epik-Moniker auction of Developed sites ends on September 23.   Here is a guided tour of some of the assets remaining from the Live Auction.  Thefull contents are  presented to you in … Slideshow.com.For anyone interested in bidding, you can do so by visiting theSnapnames Extended Auction site.  Here you will find the listings from the Live Auction as well as more than 200 other listings priced in 3-figures.  Each listing includes both a domainanda developed website. In many cases, reserves were adjusted downwards by the respective owners.  I recommend paying particular attention to some of the bundled listings — there are some great values in those bundles.

Reflections on Epik DevCon 2010	19-Sep-10	"Over the weekend, I had the opportunity to get a lot of feedback from attendees of the 1st AnnualEpik Developer Conference.  It was an action-packed 3 days and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.  I want to thank everyone who made this event possible. This post also catalogs some collected impressions of what worked, and also where we intend to improve for next year.What workedWhen we first conceived the idea of DevCon back in May, we made a leap of faith that people would come.  Some 150 days later, the event had 88 registered attendees.  For a 1st  conference, that in and of itself is an achievement.  Here is what else worked:People: Perhaps the single biggest feedback item I received was that attendees were surprised by the depth and breadth of the Epik team.  I am a strong believer that an organization is only as strong as its weakest team member. The culture of professionalism, diligence and responsiveness was on full display and the attendees noticed.Content:  TheThursday speaking schedulewas really good and the content flowed well around some central themes, notably the Domain Development Lifecycle. Many thanks to our guest speakers —Colin Pape(keynote),Andrew Allemann,David Fairley,Chad Fisher,Jay LohmanandChris Pirillofor their excellent contributions.Venue and Catering:  TheEdgewater HotelandBellHarbor Conference Centerwere two great venues.  If anything, the events wereover-catered — it was over the top. Both venues should be able to scale for at least another year in terms of accommodating DevCon’s likely growth.Program and Printed Materials:  The 3-dayprogramwas a good format, starting with registration and reception on Wednesday, a  full content program on Thursday, and half-day program on Friday. The printed materials were done at a level more typical of a contract at least 5 times the size.Community and Networking: It is safe to say that a lot of new friendships were made in addition to professional acquaintances.  The social calendar continued through the weekend as reported via emails, text messages and photos from the folks who stayed over.The Pioneer Award:  This was a large undertaking. Owen Frager, Danny Pryor, Mike and Judi Berkens, and I had lot of fun putting this Award together.The Tribute Videowas a hit.  Honoree, Rick Schwartz, graciously accepted via recorded video and also onRick’s blog.SwapFest:  This was perhaps the single biggest surprise for me.  The Dutch Auction model worked great and was a lot of fun. The SwapFest on Friday yielded more than $100,000 in sales across more than 200 auction lots. The SwapBook was prepared in advance and was available in both booklet and electronic form.EpikBucks: In the weeks leading up to DevCon,Epik was buying in domains for EpikBucks.  This gave some of the bidders the means with which to participate in SwapFest.  In addition, EpikBucks were being sold for cash for those who preferred to cash out, typically at 85 to 90 cents on the dollar.  The future is bright for both EpikBucks and SwapFest.Hospitality:  The Thursday night cruise on Elliot Bay was a big hit.  We could have done without the evening mist but thankfully the mist lifted for most of the cruise. The Wednesday night meetup at Pike Brewing was also a fun add-on event — thanks toJay Lohmanfor putting that together.Sponsors, and Swag:  Last but not least, the lead sponsorsGodaddyandMonikerweregreat.   We really appreciate their support of DevCon. The attendees also appreciated the fact-time and the swag.  We do have some bags, pens, sweatshirts and t-shirts left over for Developers who missed the event.  Contact Kristin@epik.com for details.What can be improvedLike all things, DevCon can be improved.  I have noted a few improvement points:Timing: We tried to schedule the event to not interfere with Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur — the event was in between the two and ended at noon on Friday for folks who needed to fly back East for the Saturday holiday.  Next year, the Jewish holidays start on September 29.Tentative dates for DevCon 2011 are September 14-16, 2011.  Mark your calendars!Hotel bookings: The Edgewater Hotel booked up quickly. We had guaranteed a block of rooms until August 1, but most people registered after August 1. The block of rooms that we had allocated were largely gone.  As a result, many attendees stayed elsewhere which meant more commute time for attendees.   Next year, we’ll make sure to reserve a larger block of rooms, anticipating more like 150-200 attendees versus this year’s 88.Live Auction:  Although there was some active bidding, the results to date from the Live auction fell short of my expectations.  Ironically, more deals were done during SwapFest than the Live Auction.The extended auction runs through September 23and has some very good deals.  The partnership with Moniker is solid and the foundation is laid.  Many  thanks to Jeff Kupietzky, Monte Cahn, Don Lyons, Craig Snyder and Michele van Tilborg, and Dwayne Walker for their support for DevCon.SwapFest tie-breaks:  During the Dutch auction, we had some simultaneous bids.  Rather than process all bids from one bidder selected at random before processing bids from the subsequent bidders, Kenny Hartog suggested using a round robin approach.  I agree that this would be a fairer approach and will incorporate this in the next SwapFest which is already in planning.Seattle participation:  From the roster of attendees, you would never have guessed that this event was hosted in Seattle.  One attendee from Enom, none from DomainTools, and none from Marchex.  Tim Chen of DomainTools did make an appearance at the Wednesday night meet up which was great.  I would have liked to see Seattle step up more to make this Seattle-based event something that is asharedsuccess for Seattle.  Next year.International participation: It would have been great to have more international attendance.  I was  surprised not to see anyone from China in attendance, and was also hoping to see a larger European contingent.  The short notice and long trip no doubt was a factor.  A special thanks toVishal Ithlanifor making the trip from London, andGerardo Aristizábalfor making the trip from Bogota.Overall, I could not be happier with the outcome. Thanks to everyone for making it a success and establishing a tradition that we look forward to building on for many years to come."
SwapBook for Epik SwapFest is live for download	13-Sep-10	"The much-anticipated SwapBook for this week’s Epik SwapFest is live. Herewith you will find the download of the SwapBook along with answers to questions about the process leading up to the Dutch auction on Friday for whatever remains from the Swap inventory.  A supplemental list of names will be published on Friday morning including names picked up during this week through swap transactions.Download the Epik SwapBook hereOr Click here for the Excel SpreadsheetWhy a SwapFest?At Epik, we are committed to addressing one of the largest structural challenges that impact the domain industry: the absence of conventional liquidity.  The lack of cash with which to clear transactions has led to a slow down in the pace with which domains are getting into the hands of people who can add value to them through development.  To address this, Epik developed an alternative currency called EpikBucks.Where is the Swapfest?The first ever SwapFest event is being conducted as part of the Epik Developer Conference is a forum for clearing transactions that would normally not get done in a peer-to-peer format.  The culmination of the SwapFest is on the morning of September 17 when Epik will make a large pool of domains available that are either developed or are in development and can be purchased with EpikBucks or Dollars.Why Dollars alone don’t always get the job doneOften times, the value of the raw land is increased by being able to consolidating names around a strategy, e.g. Person A wants geo names, and person B wants household appliances. However, if neither Person A nor Person B have cash, nor do either have domains that the other person wants, no transaction is completed.  This is a classic inefficient market where the only guys who get to participate are the ones with ample cash on hand.What are EpikBucks?EpikBucks are a primary basis through which Epik buys in domains that it views as being high potential for future development on the Epik platform.  EpikBucks are transferable, never expire, and can be converted into services or domain purchases from Epik and from Epik-approved partners. For purchases, EpikBucks convert on a on 1:1 basis to the US dollar listed prices.Can I use EpikBucks to bid at auction?During the Epik DevCon, EpikBucks can also be used as an accepted form of payment to settle bids made during the live auction or the extended auction.  If a domain is sold the selling party may elect to receive payment in the form of EpikBucks or cash, at their choice.  The non-cash option may be selectively attractive to the seller if their plans call for buying other domain names — a cashless, and non-taxable “like-for-like” exchange.Can EpikBucks be converted to cash?As of this writing, several Epik Developers are actively buying in EpikBucks, typically at 85 to 90 cents on the dollar.   While Epik does not redeem the EpikBucks for cash, we openly endorse the use of EpikBucks as medium of exchange and will serve as escrow agent between buyer and seller where EpikBucks transactions are involved.  Epik will actively facilitate a liquid market for EpikBucks.How do I get more EpikBucks?The easiest way to get more EpikBucks is to sell domain to Epik. In addition, we will regularly post transaction details at the conference community site (network.epik.com) about EpikBucks transactions. Details will include amounts, the buyer and what was acquired. Buyers of EpikBucks are welcome to make contact about buying EpikBucks from those who hold them.What domain names does Epik buy in?Epik is actively buying in domains that have high exact search volumes for TLDs that are known to have a good ability to develop into search-friendly destinations.   An approximate guide to the types of names that Epik is buying include:  .COM with a DQI of 500+,  .NET with a DQI of 1500+,  .US with a DQI of 10,000+, all other TLDs with DQI of 50,000+What is Domain Quality Index (DQI)?The DQI is calculated by multiple the exact search volume and multiplying by the average $ CPC.  The recommended source of statistics for computing DQI is Estibot.com or Appraise.Epik.com. While the DQI will not always identify every development candidate, it will substantially filter domains that will be difficult into search-friendly websites.What if I have a low DQI name that I really believe in but can’t develop?Most domainers have domains that they really believe in but don’t appraise highly by conventional metrics.  For these names, we recommend using the online forum at network.epik.com to let others know if your domain holdings and an indication of what you would accept as fair compensation.Which domains are being made available?At a minimum, Epik is making available more than 3,000 domains. These are included in the SwapBook. In addition, before, during and after DevCon, Epik will continue to buy in more domains that Epik believes have high development potential.  These domains will also be made available to participants in the SwapFest program.Why are there no prices in the Swap book?During DevCon, Epik will regularly conduct bulk transactions for domains that are in its SwapBook.  On 9/17, domains remaining will be made available using a Dutch auction format where domains will be made available on a first come first serve basis at progressively falling prices starting at $9,999 and falling to $199.  The sale price includes both a domain name and a website.  The domains that are not sold at $199 will remain on Epik’s books.Will there be other Swapfests?The main Swapfest will be conducted annually at the Epik Developer Conference. In addition, Epik will be working with other conference organizers to schedule Swapfests around other conference events where domain investors are known to participate.  Online tools for ongoing Swap trades will also continue to evolve in the months ahead."
Pardon our Dust	12-Sep-10	"August was a month of what I have come to call “hypergrowth”.   The business nearly tripled in August compared to July.  During the same period, quality actually improved.  And while  operating gaps remain, we know what they are and are closing them.  Here is a brief recap of August and a rundown of what you can expect from Epik.August was a break-out monthThe number of Developersgoing big-time on Epikexploded in August. Revenues in August were up184%versus July.  This excludes the impact of developer credit, orEpikBucks, as these revenues are either not captured as revenue, or are characterized as deferred revenue per GAAP.  Revenue from sites was also at record levels.The growth in August was largely about the explosive growth of Product Portals which is now at 6,000+ stores as we execute the strategy of hyper-segmenting the online retail market through a federated network of online stores. They work. In parallel to building them at scale, we are improving the user experience on a weekly basis.Of course, when you triple the size of the business in a single month, some details will get overlooked — no matter how many smart guys are logging 100 hour weeks.  The good news is that we head into this week’s DevCon, Epik’s team and products have never been stronger.  And while the job isneverdone, the action steps are clear.Looking aheadAt next week’sEpik DevCon, John Lawler, SVP Technology at Epik, will highlight some of the Development initiatives that are under way. If you are coming to DevCon, don’t miss John’s session on “The Domain Development Toolbox”. Here are the main developments that are currently under way at Epik for delivery in the coming weeks:Administrative Control Panel:  This one has been a long-time coming.  It allows Epik Developers to be able to login and manage all of their Epik-powered sites through one master control panel with daily stats and centralized accounting.Dropshipping: The first of the product portals to support drop-shipping are going live. Our goal is to be able to more broadly support drop-shipping starting in Q4 2010 for product portals that have achieved critical mass in terms of volume of paid clicks or sustained top-ranking in their categories.Directory Portals:Directory Portalsare moving into what we internally refer to as “The Factory”.  To date, the emphasis has been on launching the Directory content network, e.g. Dining.com. In the coming weeks, we will complete the integration of the Sandpoint, Idaho call center for high volume outbound sales of enhanced directory listings to service providers listed in the directory portals.Video Portals:Video Portalshave been in development for duration of the summer.  The first live video portal will be live in time for DevCon.  We specifically designed the video portals to power .TV domains.  And so for anyone wondering why .TV domains have been slow to rank in the search engines, our belief is that it has a lot to do with the lack of useful content, or compelling user experiences. Video Portals combine content, community and commerce around themes.Recipe Portals:  What does one do with a domain name like TomatoSoup.com? Up until  now, our only solution would be to sell Tomato Soup products via a Product Portal. Not a bad option for canned or dried tomato soup, but not a great solution for BananaBread.com or Manicotti.com.  We needed a platform for Recipes that ties back to a semantic architecture and monetized via sale of related ingredients, advertising, and lead-generation fordiningand culinary-related services.Person name Portals:  Let’s suppose you own JohnSmith.com, Bobby.com,  or Smith.com.  What do you do with those?  After more than a year of negotiations, Epik has entered into an exclusive partnership with people search leader, PeopleFinders.com to produce SEO-friendly portals that can rank on person names, as well as person names with geo, e.g. JohnSmith.com/Chicago-Illinois catalogs all persons named John Smith in Chicago Illinois. Monetization is through upsell to background searches.Job Portals: The last portal category that we are actively developing is a Job Portal platform.  In our view the job board market is ripe for hyper-segmentation, e.g. names like ChicagoNursingJobs.com that are basically parked and yet have 500+ exact match monthly searches with $3+ CPC.  Vast numbers of these names are either unregistered or undeveloped.  We think this represents a market that search has yet to disrupt.  Domains can help with the hyper-segmentation of the job board market.Attendees of next week’s DevCon will see previews of each of these development initiatives.  So, Pardon our Dust.  The Future of Domaining looks brighter than ever!"
So what exactly is a Developer anyway: Donald Trump or Steve Jobs?	10-Sep-10	"At Epik, we use the termDeveloperto describe the community of entrepreneurs that are building out domains on the Epik Platform. The interesting thing about the termDeveloperis that it means different things to different people. If you come fromReal Estateyou might think Donald Trump.  If you come from Computing orInternet, you might be thinking Steve Jobs. So, who would you expect to find at anInternet Real Estate Development Conference? Donald Trump or Steve Jobs?Conferences provide some insightAs withTRAFFICorDomainFest, the predominant demographic of the registered attendance for theEpik Developer Conferenceisnottechnical.  The largest Developers building on Epik  are overwhelmingly coming from a Real Estate background.  In the past, they Developed hotels, restaurants, houses, condos, offices, cottages and cabins.  And in most cases, they made money, at least until the recent economic downturn started to play havoc with the residential and commercial real estate business model.Real Estate Developersintuitively understand the importance of LOCATION. On the web, thelocationis measured largely by the caliber of your web address.  The alternative path to credibility would be to spend heavily on building a brand.  Consider for a moment,Epik.com. Epik is a brand. How much did we spend on developing that brand? A lot.  And even though we are reasonably adept at SEO, we are still not top-ranked by Google for our #1 keyword “Domain Development”. Huh?Location, Location, Location. ThinkMLS not DNS.So which is it — Donald Trump or Steve Jobs?This leads me to the definitive question —is an Internet Real Estate Developer more like a Donald Trump or a Steve Jobs?According to a scientific survey of attractive women, it turns out thatThe Donaldhas a96% rating for “Women magnetism”.  As for Steve Jobs’ “Women magnetism”, in the same highly scientific study,Steve Jobswas a lowly85% rating for Women magnetism. Case closed. The Donald wins.So, what’s the big difference between The Domain Developer and The Donald?  The Donald has to worry about finding tenants and about guests making messes in the guest rooms.   The Domain Developer doesn’t."
Seattle Domainer Meetup on 9/15	9-Sep-10	"Friend of Epik,Jay Lohmann, will be moderating theEpik DevConlunchtime panel on 9/16 withAndrew AllemannandChris Pirillo.  Jay also enjoys spending time visiting microbreweries and has organized a Meetup atPike Brewingon Wednesday 9/15.  We invite you to come have a beer on Epik and meet up with domain investors who are visiting from out of town.The Pike Brewery is at 1415 1st Avenue in Seattle — very near Pike Place Market on 1st Ave. It is walking distance from the main hotels where most of the DevCon conference attendees are staying. Jay secured use of the Brewery museum at Pike Brewing.  Jay promises to be on hand to tap the keg at 7 pm.  DevCon attendees may not be too far behind. Hope to see you there."
So who is BUYING EpikBucks?	7-Sep-10	"The objective of creatingEpikBucksis to create amedium of exchangeto enable transactions that would otherwise not get done, or would be considered taxable events subject to capital gains taxes.  Deals are getting done using EpikBucks as a medium of exchange.  So, the obvious question then ishow to convert EpikBucks to CASH. As one would expect in an efficient market, a solution emerges for that as well.Earlier today, Kenny Hartog asked me if he could buy in EpikBucks from people who get them.  Yes, of course.  So, for folks who have received newly-minted EpikBucks, there are buyers like Kenny who would otherwise be using cash to pay for services or domain purchases.  You can contract with these individuals directly to work out the exchange rate.  For small transactions, I expect it to be 85 cents on the dollar, and for larger transactions, 90 cents on the dollar.  Win-win.Once the transaction has been confirmed by buyer and seller, EpikBucks a free transfer is done from the seller’s EpikBucks account to the buyer’s account.  For folks looking for a cash exit from an EpikBucks position, we’ll do our best to facilitate a transaction and create a liquid market for buyer and seller.  That being said, for anyone holding EpikBucks,my advice is to hold onto your EpikBucks until at least September 17— the day ofSwapFest!And for anyone wondering if Kenny is off his rocker, Kenny shared this screen shot of Kenny’s daily traffic. The percentages were the % increases versus the day before – Monday vs. Sunday.  Of course, not every day is going to rack up1, 2 and 3 digit percentage increases.That would be statistically impossible. What is important is that Kenny is reporting a whole lot of upticks.  In statistical terms, that would be very real growth, andnotstatistical noise.These sites are making the jump from pages 3 to 10+ on the search engines, to mostly page 2.  A site likeIceCreamMaker.com, which is #1 on page 1 of Google, will book 350-500 organic visits per DAY.  So, what you are seeing in the above screen shot is the start of exponential growth that we typically see between days 60 and 150.  This S-curve organic growth pattern is also describedhere. Kenny will be at Epik DevCon next week. He is reachable at kentog@gmail.com."
"Yes, you can use your EpikBucks to pay for Epik DevCon Registration"	6-Sep-10	"A question came in from an individual who plans to attendEpik DevConnext week in Seattle.  He asked if it would be possible to pay for his conference registration with EpikBucks.  The short answer isyes.  In other words,you can pay for your conference registration with domain names.  How cool is that?  For domainers who are long on domains, but short on cash:problem solved.  See you at DevCon. Bring some EpikBucks and save some for Friday 9/17. 😉"
EpikBucks	6-Sep-10	"Happy Labor Day.  In anticipation of the Epik DevConLive Auction on 9/16and theRuilverkaveling SwapFest on 9/17, EpikBucks deals are getting done at a steady pace.  Here are a couple of deals from earlier today that illustrate the EpikBucks model for creating industry liquidity.A Portfolio acquired for $10,000 EpikBucksKonstantin Kostov completed asweetheart dealwith Epik a couple weeks back and is going big-time on Epik.  Earlier today, Konstantin and Epik completed a purchase deal. For $10,000 in EpikBucks, we picked up these development-grade domains:navydresses.comblackpartydresses.comweddingsets.copencilskirts.netvioletdress.commonitorstands.netcomputervideogames.netcarcinoma.netorientalcabinets.comtrack-suits.comyellowsundress.comcameracell.comcornerworkstation.comuniquerings.netarmyskirts.compencamera.nettimberbeds.comSo now Epik owns these and someone else can build on them — taking them out of the parking lot, if you will. In the meantime, Epik will schedule to build all of them for its own account.   Win-win.SwapFest.com for $3,500 EpikBucksA second transaction today involves the 1999 registration of SwapFest.com. Michael Todaro has renewed this name since 1999. A narrow trademark was filed in 2005 in the automotive category — 6 yearsafterSwapFest.com was used in interstate commerce.  The background here is that “Todaro” noted with interest that Epik is getting into the Domain Swap business, and scheduled aswap eventaround it.  He has long had plans to build the domain but never got around to it.  He thought Epik could use it. I agreed. We bought it for $3,500 in EpikBucks as a strategic purchase. The $3500 is enough to build at least 14 portals and replaces a name that was just costing renewal fees. Win-win.A word on EpikBucksWe are excited to see adoption of EpikBucks as an industry currency.   The upcoming launch of the Epik Admin Portal will also enable users to access updated accounting of their EpikBucks balance and transaction history.  Also note that the EpikBucks are transferable, do not expire, and can be used to buy domains, buy services or bid at an Epik-branded auction.  Although formal trading market for EpikBucks does not currently exist, we certainly will encourage those who have them and need cash to trade with those who want EpikBucks for an upcoming transaction.  I have little doubt that an after-market will emerge soon on a domain blog near you.  And, for the record, we are fine with that."
Our latest custom development project: ETF.com	5-Sep-10	"When it comes to domain names, the cream of the crop are known as “category-defining domain names”, a domain name that exactly describes the type of business or subject the site is about. To be sure, having such a domain name is not in itself sufficient for success, but the odds are greatly improved, particularly in a world where direct navigation is becoming more popular.Epik owns, or is in partnership with, quite a number of such names, some of which have been built out, and some of which are awaiting the right partner to turn the domain name into a category killer.Epik’s newest entry into our portfolio of category-defining domain names isETF.com.Those of you versed in finance are now nodding your heads, while the rest of you are rubbing your eyes. ETF.com? What is that?Investopedia describes an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) as “a security that tracks an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but trades like a stock on an exchange. ETFs experience price changes throughout the day as they are bought and sold. By owning an ETF, you get the diversification of an index fund as well as the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as little as one share. Another advantage is that the expense ratios for most ETFs are lower than those of the average mutual fund.”In short, ETFs combine the best aspects of stocks and mutual funds. They’re a dessert toppinganda floor wax.ETFs have become a hugely attractive investment instrument because of their low costs, tax efficiency, and stock-like features, and now make up over 50% of the trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange, truly amazing for something so new and so little understood by most investors.And that’s where ETF.com comes in. As a comprehensive repository of information about ETFs, it is well positioned to become the go-to site for anyone looking to learn about ETFs in general, as well as the daily results of that day’s trading.But recall my earlier comment that a great, category defining domain name like ETF.com is not in itself sufficient for success. You need only look atmutualfunds.comandstocks.com, two parked sites that are wasting the value of those domain names. The owners of ETF.com had built the foundation of a strong site, but it wasn’t resolving properly, some of its features were incomplete, and it needed a refreshed design.And so, enter Epik. We’ve entered into a development partnership in which we will lead the ongoing development of new features as well as an improved design. We’ve only been at it a week, but the results so far are strong.Over the coming weeks we will be further improving the site’s looks and feel while adding even more compelling new features. Of particular note will be the creation of the ETF.com Advisor Network, a directory of financial institutions and experts who can provide advice on how ETFs might fit into one’s investment portfolio. And for those who prefer to do it themselves, we have implemented the first iteration of the ETF Screener, which allows you to search for ETFs based on a wide variety of characteristics and investment goals.Our development work on ETF.com is a excellent example of the breadth of Epik’s development capabilities. While the bulk of our efforts revolve around the creation of the technology platforms that power our online stores and directories, we also do custom development when the right name comes along.We are very excited about the prospects for ETF.com. It is an excellent example of the value (and valuation!) that can be generated when a category-defining domain name is matched up with a custom developed web site, and how development projects such as this can help turn a category-defining domain name into a “category killer” business.It should also be noted that ETF.com will be available as part of thedomain auctionbeing held on September 16th during the Epik Developers Conference. It would make an ideal acquisition for any brokerage or private equity firm."
Coming to DevCon?  Register in advance and start Networking!	4-Sep-10	"On Friday, the Epik DevCon conference team unveiled some cool new tools for enabling networking by DevCon attendees.   This is a slick platform that is intended for making connections with fellow participants in this unique event.The Conference Network PlatformThe platform is powered by Seattle-based Pathable.com. It has already proven to be useful in helping the Developer community to meet up ahead of DevCon.  I first came across Pathable last month when I was a judge on a startup competition calledPitchSlam.  Chris Pirillo of Lockergnome, who will be headlining the 9/16 lunchtime panel, was also a judge. Having attended many conferences over the years, I have often found it to be a real advantage to know who else is coming, and to be able to communicate with them before, during and after the conference.  So, after seeing the Pathable demo, I was excited to try it out. Here is what it looks like:At Epik, we are committed to building a Network of Developers.  We know that many Developers have connected through Epik.  That’s great.  We hope to enable a lot more social and professional connections both at the 1st Annual Conference, and in the months and years ahead.Who can use these Networking tools?Registered delegates should have already received an invitation.  If you received an invitation, you will need to click the RSVP link and fill in a short profile in order to start using the community tools.  Who is eligible to use the community tools?– You are a registered attendee, sponsor, or speaker– You have an asset listed in the live auction on 9/16– You have one or more live sites currently on EpikContact Kristine Oliver (Kristine@epik.com), for any questions about accessing the online community area forDevCon. If you are planning to attend,registerin advance.  It will save you $200 versus the on-site registration.  Also, while the conference venue has plenty of space, the Thursday night cruise has a capacity limit.  So,Don’t miss the Boat."
Would you buy a kit car?	4-Sep-10	"Morgan Linton had a good post this week about theDomain Dream changing.  This morning “Steve” had a very insightful comment.Here is what Steve said:Its very simple,  90 % of current domain sales are Domainers to Domainers. Why? Because we can understand the potential value and the only way to increase values is to Develop them into websites, so  end users can see  the value. Who has the larger share of the market ? Kit cars or factory-made cars ready to drive away? Its that simple.Steve is right!  This image below perhaps makes Steve’s point even more clear:The fact is that most end clients or entrepreneurs have no interest in building a kit car.  They don’t want to learn PHP, Mysql, WordPress, Joomla, Linux, or whatever technologies you care to mention.  Anyone who has tried to develop a website and make a go of turning it into a profitable venture, knows that it is not easy.I speak almost every day to someone who has the equivalent of a partially assembled kit car sitting in the garage.  Some of them are enormous names.   For example, last Tuesday, Epik releasedETF.com.  We are really excited about it.  When we got it, ETF.com was a partially assembled site that did not even resolve!For anyone who had a dream or a vision when they originally acquired a domain, my advice is simple: find someone capable of finishing the job.  If it were me, I would certainly pick Epik, but if you can find a capable developer who can help you to Develop, Operate, and Sell the finished product, now is the time toShift out of Park.On September 16, David Fairley ofWebsite Propertieswill speak at Epik DevCon.  Dave has sold a lot of developed websites, and will provide perspective on the difference between selling an undeveloped domain and selling a developed website."
Epik DevCon Domain Swap Event on 9/17 – Miss it and Miss out!	2-Sep-10	"There is a great deal of anticipation about theDomain Swap event we have planned for the Epik DevCon.  This post provides some context aboutwhatwe seek to accomplish by conducting this unique swap event andwhy.The Single Biggest Problem in the Domain Industry: Absence of LiquiditySince becoming a full-time domain investor/developer in March 2009, I have watched in disbelief asamazingnames go undeveloped, andgoodnames get dropped.  Savvy domain investors are expanding their portfolios while many domain investors play “lifeboat” with their portfolio, paring back to the high potentials and the existing money-makers. This is what recessions do — they compel efficiency.  And there is no question, this is one Mother of a Recession, and I stand pat onmy assessment that it is not over.Many domain investors would like to strengthen their portfolios as well as begin todevelopdomains.  However, the challenge for much of the industry players is that cash is finite.  And because cash is the medium of exchange for most transactions, deals that should get done, often do not get done.  Why? Because at any given time, Person A does not have what Person B wants, whether that is cash or alike-for-like exchange.  The result is aBuyers marketwhere only the guys with cash get to play.  Raw deal? You bet.The more I studied this market, the more I became convinced that the Domain Industry needs amedium of exchangethat is not limited to reserve currencies.  We have seen this work on a small scale by paying for domains with Developer Credit (akaEpikBucks) and then allowing the Developer to use this currency for buying development services, buying other domains, or holding the EpikBucks in reserve for future activity.  The key was to make this currencytransferable,non-expiringandconvertibleinto value.So how do you get EpikBucks?The Epik team has been thinking about the model for Domain Swaps for some time.   How does one create liquidity for development-grade domains without a room full of cash buyers willing to pay fair market value? We think we have a solution that scales.  It is a modified version of a “Silent Dutch Auction”. Here is how it works:A domain owner submits a list of names to Epik.  The Epik team appraises the development-grade domains.  While this appraisal process is part art and part science, we think it is not all that different than having a gem grader that appraises an uncut diamond.The domain owner can now offer the domain to others and determine if there is acash buyerat Epik’s price or better.  If there is not a cash buyer, Epik will buy it for the indicated number in the form of EpikBucks.   The EpikBucks are now transferable, won’t expire, and can be redeemed for domains or services, and eventually more.The domain is now owned by Epik. In most cases, the newly acquired domain will be made available to others for development on the most favorable terms possible, relative to the basis at which the domain was acquired by Epik from the prior owner.If you havedevelopment-gradedomains that you want to swap or sell, send the list toswap@epik.com. We’ll review them and come back to you with appraisals, in EpikBucks, for your review and consideration.  It may take us a day or two, but we’ll keep you posted on our progress.   To save time with the sorting the wheat from the chaff, please note that we are looking for names with aDomain Quality Index (DQI)of 500+, i.e. Exact search per month multiplied by CPC as reported by Estibot or Appraise.Epik.com.  Parked domains with 500+ monthly visits are also fair game.So what happens on 9/17 in Seattle?On 9/17, at the Domain Swap event in Seattle, we will physically post the inventory on the morning of 9/17 at 7:30 am PT. The inventory will consist ofthousandsof development-grade domains where buyers can pick up any domain by writing in their unique bidder ID.  The vast majority of these assets will be listed at$249, fora development-grade domain with a turn-key website.  These domains will often appraise for thousands of dollars on Estibot and in most cases, Epik is now giving them away for free.  The Domain Swap inventory will beexclusively available for bidding by registered participantsat Epik DevCon.  Post-conference, the list of sites that were not taken by DevCon Swap participants, will be sent to a 7-day publiccash auction.September 2010 marks the official kick-off of EpikBucksOn 9/17 at 10 am PT, we’ll start theEpikBucks-enabled swap eventwith a briefing by Epik CFO and Counsel, Cliff Beer.  He will explain the accounting mechanics of EpikBucks and supervise the transaction clearing process. He will also a brief update on the financial health and strength of Epik for those who care to know such things. In the meantime, for your amusement, here is Ala Dadan’s rendering of an EpikBuck.   🙂Although we reallydon’ttake ourselvesthatseriously, the principle of having alivingandaccountableperson on the face of a currency is not a bad one.  Imagine if the stewards of our national currencies would be accountable for thepurchasing powerfor their currencies. Now there is a thought!  And as for the purchasing power of an EpikBuck …The Buck Stops Here."
How long does it take to see significant organic traffic for a new site?	2-Sep-10	"One of the interesting things to understand about domain development is the timing of the development cycle as it relates to organic search.  The reality is that organic traffic to a previously parked page will typically not arrive overnight. There is a timing to it which correlates heavily to search position.In this example, IceCreamMaker.com launched at the beginning of the year.  Traffic grew steadily as it rose out of obscurity to page 2 of Google, and then to page 1, and then to the top 1-2 positions on page 1. The resulting traffic impact is easy to see and is highly correlated to search position.And here is a link to the full report for anyone interested:Analytics_www.icecreammaker.com_201001-201008_(Since_1_1_2010)During the early phases of the site’s life, pay attention to the following stages:1. Your site is indexed.You can check this easily by going to Google and using thesite:IceCreamMaker.comcommand to see how many pages are indexed.  After 30 days of the site being live, you should see significant indexing, i.e. the % of pages on the site that are known to exist in Google.2.Your site is ranked.For starters, you are looking for the exact match term “ice cream maker” and wanting to see the ranking improve from pages 3-10 to pages 1-2.  If you have a lot of sites, you can check them using a number of rank-checking tools includingthis one.3. Your site is top-ranked.The real battle begins on page 1 of Google.  The top 3 positions get approximately 40% of the traffic.  Said another way, having a descriptive domain that is ranked above the fold on page 1 of Google is a very good place to be.4. Your site ranks on adjacent terms:  Once your site ranks on the exact match term, start looking for the related terms, e.g. Ice Cream Makers (plural), or ranking for specific brands in the case of a product portal.  This adjacent ranking opens up additional growth opportunities for the site’s organic traffic.Last but not least, if you have an Epik-powered site and want to add Google Analytics to your site, just create the tracking code in Google Webmaster Tools and send it to optimize@epik.com and we’ll be happy to include your tracking code."
A 5th way to go big-time on Epik – A savings plan	1-Sep-10	"A popular post on this blog discussed 4 case studies that showedhow Epik Developers are achieving scale economies.   These models all came from listening to the Developer Community and responding with innovative solutions that map to personal situations and goals.  Earlier today I had the opportunity to speak to another ambitious Epik developer who helped Epik to design a plan that made sense for him and is a win-win.50 Sites in 50 WeeksA one-off custom site development costs $249, whereas a 50-site portfolio development costs $189 per site. So, how does one get volume pricing without having to write a big check on day one?  At the request of Epik Developer, Anthony Williams, we came up with a plan that calls for building 50 sites over 50 weeks at the bulk rate of $189.  There are are a few advantages for Anthony that made it compelling:Cost savings– Developers whose goal is financial independence recognize that one site alone does not a retirement plan make. For most mid-market names, I estiimate that you are looking at more like a 100 site portfolio to have a good shot at live-on-it passive income within a few years of launch.  As such, buying in bulk makes sense.Preferred placement in the production schedule— Developers with pre-paid credit have development priority versus the one-off requests which are currently waiting an average of 17 days to get their sites built.Ability to plan ahead— I am a big fan of clustering sites around themes.  If you know you will be developing 50-100 sites, you can plan ahead knowing what types of sites should get built and how they will be able to leverage off of each other.  Moreover, ultimately, an acquirer can look at the totality of the traffic from the portfolio.The goal of Epik is to make developing on Epik as cost-effective as possible.  We are on the lookout for innovative approaches that make cost-effective development accessible for anyone.

in which the site is active, let us know and we’ll investigate.  In terms of traffic monetization, there are two other items to highlight:We are piloting a program that gives merchants the ability to upload their own SKUs.  There is a fee per SKU per month charged to the merchant but then no CPC is assessed. This is a win-win for the advertiser and the domain owner due to a predictable arrangement.  Advertisers can pay a higher rate to be featured on the home page.During Q4, we will rollout Dropshipping across a range of product categories. A trial is currently in progress with a live portal.  We are also investigating the feasibility of using EpikBucks as a currency for enablingconsumersto be able to purchases dropship goods.  Stay tuned.Last but not least we are gearing up for the all-important year-end holiday shopping period, which starts around October 15 and winds down by December 15.  Now is the time to be building sites in order to be well-positioned for the 2010 year-end holiday period. Keep in mind that the typical leadtime to get a site ranked organically is 30-45 days."
"If you think DevCon is expensive, I have news."	31-Aug-10	"We are now just 15 days from the start what promises to be a great conference.  Yesterday evening I had a discussion with a new Epik Developer. It gave me an insight into how theEpik DevConis perceived — he thought the conference was expensive.  In fact, DevCon is an insanely good deal. One short discussion later, the new Developer agreed and registered. Read on and I think you will agree!The original intention of the Epik Developer Conference was never to be a money-making event in and of itself. We fully expect to put more into it than we would immediately get back. Rather, it is intended as a dialog among stakeholders who want to earn recurring passive income while at the same time making the web work better.  The event was really never intended for Looky-loos who don’t have a sincere interest in Domain Development or the Future of Domaining. The $795 price-tag screens out the Looky-Loos.So, here is what you get as a registered delegate for your $795 Registration feeA minimum of $500 in Developer Credit (aka EpikBucks): You can use this credit for buying domains, development services, content from Epik partners, or bidding at auction.  And the EpikBucks never expire and are fully transferable to other Epik developers.A seat at the table at a very cool event: While Seattle may not be famous for its hospitality, we have put together aprogramthat we think delegates will find fun and rewarding.  I am confident that this conference will make you money and that you will have a good time.Quality time with some very smart people:  I have seen what happens when you bring a group of smart, focused people together for a couple of days.  I expect DevCon will be no exception. To make it even easier to meet fellow delegates, later this week, we’ll release an online community platform for the conference.Domain Swap event will be a game-changer:  The Friday (9/17) morning Domain Swap event will be one of several game-changers.  As part of the Swap event, Epik will make a pool of approximately 3,000 developed sites available for rock bottom reserve prices. These can be bought for cash or EpikBucks.Some great take-aways and some great give-aways: The learning content from the content-packed program should yield some great take-away insights.  We also look forward to giving away many of the great domain names that we were able secure over the past year to those who wish to develop them.For bargain hunters, note that there are a few Promocodes floating around fromGodaddyand Owen Frager’sDomain Success.  And for those who need financial assistance, we’ll do our best to help out.  Seriously, if you still think DevCon is a questionable investment, let me know (rob@epik.com or robertmonster on Skype)."
Four ways to build big-time on Epik — without breaking the bank	29-Aug-10	"Epik Developers are having success.  A growing number of them are expanding their portfolios to the point that the investment level in domains and portals becomes material.  This post discusses 4 case studies of individuals who are building big-time without breaking the bank.Volume Pricing – Kenny HartogThe story of Kenny’s success on the Epik platform is not new. He was one of the very first to develop on Epik, and has focused almost entirely on Product Portals where he had early success and where he has continued to scale.  Kenny’s volume price is $175 per portal.   In the interest of transparency, here is how we discount with volume orders:< 10 portals – $24910+ portals – $22920+ portals – $21930+ portals – $20940+ portals – $19950+ portals – $189100+ portals – $175The intent of the setup fees is not actually to earn a margin.  It is to recoup the hard costs of building a custom site and getting the site to start cash-flowing from organic traffic.  You could easily spend $175 to 249 on just designing a custom logo.  For this budget, Epik builds an entire turn-key custom site and will operate it for as long as the domain is pointing to Epik with no additional investment by the domain owner.  The domain owner can sell or leave any time and keep 100% of the proceeds from a sale of the enhanced domain.Co-Development Agreements – Oliver HogerOliver hit the ground running with Epik. He is one of the most effective domain acquirers that I know, and had plenty of development-grade domains in his portfolio.  However, Oliver was  looking for a development partner and was willing to leave some upside on the table in exchange for waiving development fees for his high quality portfolio.  Epik is developing nearly 100 sites for Oliver, including the likes ofPolice.net, which went live last week and immediately received an unsolicited multi-5-figure offer.  The pricing model for development is that there is zero setup fee.  Epik shares 50/50 in the operating revenue and receives 30% of the proceeds from an eventual sale of the developed domain.  The domain owner maintains registrar control and is under no obligation to ever sell the developed domain.Developer Credit via Domain Exchange – Aaron WilkenAaron is both good at drop-catching and also good at finding high value hand-registration opportunities.   Over the years, he assembled a lot of product category domains which happens to be a very good fit with Epik.  He was not interested in investing the full amount to fund development so we began trading development services for domains.  Recently, Epik acquired a portfolio of domains from Aaron.  We paid $12,500 in Developer Credit — something that we callEpikBucks.  EpikBucks are transferable, never expire, and can be used to buy services or domains from Epik, as well as bid at Epik-sponsored auctions. EpikBucks will be formally introduced in time for theEpik Developer Conference.Enterprise Licensing – Morgan SchwartzMorgan Schwartz is one of the original Friends of Epik, dating back to even before the days of Product Portals.  Morgan is also technical, and a savvy drop-catcher. He embraced the Epik vision pretty much from the get-go and endured our early experiments at developing scalable approaches to domain development.  Morgan has since built many product portals on the Epik platform and has had success in building a portfolio of sites that are providing recurring passive income.   When Morgan learned that Epik was considering a self-serve development platform that did not charge setup fees and offered a higher revenue-share, he was pretty keen.  During August, Morgan completed a full-day of on-site training at the Sandpoint, Idaho Operations Center where Luke Webster and team are based.  Epik now offers 3 tiers of Enterprise service, including a 100% rev-share and white-label solution for large scale developers.  An overview of Enterprise licensing is describedhere. Pleasecontact usfor details.These 4 examples are all illustrative of a larger point.   And that is that Epik is that is listening to market feedback and developing innovative approaches that align incentives with the growing Epik Developer Community.  The example provided here focuses on Product portals but the principles apply equally to other Epik-powered platforms."
Does your Epik site need a tune-up?	28-Aug-10	"One of my favorite places in the world is a placed calledCaneel Bayin St. John.  One of the long-time staffers is an aging bartender who has a rather unique presence.  If you ask him how he is doing, healwayshas one pat answer, delivered with characteristic Carribean glee:Could be better …. There isalwaysroom for Improvement!And that about sums up how I think about Epik. Simply stated, the bar is never high enough! The only question iswhoraises the bar?With Growth comes ResponsibilityIn a relatively short amount of time, the Epik platform has become significant.  The Product Portal platform alone extends to more than 5,000 stores.  We are proud of this progress, but by no means complacent.  With thousands of live sites, and hundreds of owners, we also know that there are a lot of stakeholders that are counting on Epik to get it right.  I am confident that we will.  One reason for my confidence is because there are a lot of eyeballs on the lookout for areas for improvement. I call this a “demanding customer” relationship believe it is key to success.  We don’t want passive customers.  We want engaged partners.  That’s how we win.KaizenWhen I was living in Japan, from 1995 through 1999, the termKaizenwas widely used in manufacturing. The term describes a process of “continuous improvement” and was an import from Edward Deming, an American process design expert who was famous in Japan long before he was respected in his home country.By the same token, at Epik, we believe that Development is not an event.  Rather, it is a process.  The process of optimization never stops. As such, we have provided Developers with an email alias for convenient use when relaying feedback –Optimize@epik.com. If you see an improvement area, let us know.Here are a few of the main areas that we are watching closely:SEO execution:  This is one of the highest ROI tasks.  Well-executed Title, H1, H2, Meta and Alt tags are price of entry for a high performing site.  When we get that part right on an exact-match domain name, the prospects of achieving a solid initial ranking is good.Links:  Epik does provide an embedded network of contextual backlinks.   We continue to refine our approach for collecting links and will be expanding the link development program substantially this Fall.Product or Content mix:  A good indicator of whether the user experience is being fulfilled is bounce rate, i.e. the % of visitors who leave your site promptly after visiting without engaging with any of the content.  A tuned Epik site will have a bounce rate of under 20%.Graphics: In general, our graphics are pretty good. However, sometimes we get it wrong and the graphic does not do justice to the business opportunity.  Well-executed graphics are important for the brand.  It won’t drive traffic, but it will drive engagement.Site performance: Exponential growth usually does not come without growing pains.  Epik is no exception.  One by one, these platforms are maturing into robust profit engines.  If your site loads slowly or has errors, let us know.Indexing and Ranking:  If you see notable moves in your indexing or ranking, we are always interested in knowing about possible insights into the why behind the what.  Many Epik Developers are experimenting with different strategies for promoting their sites.  Let us know what worked.Monetization Patterns: Todd Johnson reported this week about his success with color domains. That is an insight that we had not picked up on before, but learned because Todd was minding the store — his stores specifically. That insight has now helped other Developers.User experience and Functionality: Although improvements to the user interface don’t usually happen overnight, much of the improvements are driven by listening to Developer feedback.  Keep the feedback coming.Thanks for listening, and thanks for the feedback."

Guest Post: Securing Your Place in The SEO Universe	24-Aug-10	"Chad FisherofPyramid SEOwill be speaking at theEpik DevConon the morning of September 16.   His talk will be part of ourAcquire-Develop-Operate-Sellseries. Chad is an SEO veteran.  He regularly consults with Epik Developers and also manages one of our content sourcing relationships.   In this guest post, Chad shares some thoughts on SEO.The SEO UniverseYour newly-minted website is just one of millions.  In the universe of websites, it starts out as more or less insignificant.  Moreover, with web publishing tools making it easier than ever to produce content on an expanding array of top level domains (TLDs), the competition for top ranking by search engines is getting tougher. So, how exactly does a web developer, stand out in all this vastness we callThe SEO Universe?Looking the partFor openers, you must have a professional looking site to effectively perform link building. If you have an amateurish site featuring AdSense ads plastered above the fold, you are going to suffer a horrible bounce rate and no one is going to want to link to you. Moreover, if you start ranking on competitive keywords you might get a Google manual quality review. If that happens and your site looks like it was built solely for an AdSense click, you could suffer a manual penalty.Assuming your sitelooksprofessional, you now need to acquire unique and authoritative content. You can either write this content yourself or hire a professional writer. For example, in the financial services category for which I build sites, I often hire writers through Craigslist or use my own in house team to locate industry-specific expertise. In addition, you can encourage user generated content – a forum or a blog (where you allow comments) can help you tremendously in creating a lot of user generated content.Once the sitelooksgood, and has a base of original content, you can begin the process of securing organic backlinks.Domain Diversity is Key for BacklinksThe number of root domains linking to your domain is a huge quality signal to Google. Ideally the majority of your domains are in the same theme, for example if you have a site about personal injury law, many of your inbound links should also be from other legal sites. However, it is important to remember that there are a number of indirectly related niches you should be considering. To improve your overall domain diversity, you can look for finance, insurance and other business sites that may not be 100% topical but still increase the overall number of domains linking in — a key SEO metric. For more insight on how to improve domain diversity, take a look at thispost on the SEO moz blog.Anchor Text Diversity is ImportantDiversifying the anchor text of the links back to your site is very important. For starters, if you are trying to build links with this anchor text: “picture frames” and everyone one of your links uses exactly the same anchor text, you have a very good chance of tripping an automated Google filter. Once you do this your rankings will drop and typically only come back after a set amount of time, likely measured in months.Even more important, if you fixate on just one set of anchor text, you are missing out on the SEO value available from related phrases. Consider our example of “picture frames”. By adding the words: “cheap”, “discount”, “low cost”, or “buy” you have greatly expanded the number of phrases for which you can rank.  You will also get some credit for the root phrase, “picture frames”. This concept is explained in more detailhere.Diversity in the Types of Links Is CriticalIt’s easy to get caught up in one link building method. For example, there are some article marketers that only build links through writing content and submitting to the popular directories. There are others who just submit their site to free or paid directories as their preferred method to build links. In reality you should be combining many different link types. Here are a few examples:–          Article Submissions (Ezine, Articles Base, etc)–          Paid and Free Directories–          Press Releases–          Guest Posts–          Forum Profiles–          Forum Posts–          Blogroll Exchanges–          Link Exchanges–          Content Aggregator Sites (Squidoo, Hub Pages, etc)–          Infographics–          Viral Pictures, Images or Content (Linkbait)–          Affiliate Programs–          Blog CommentsIf you hit 90% of these link building techniques you will greatly improve the diversity of your links with a resulting dramatic increase in the organic traffic to your site!"
This is what they call a Stick-save	24-Aug-10	"I have gone on recordhereandhereto rotate out of stocks and bonds and into domains and websites.  I am sticking to this call.  In fact, today was what traders call a “stick save”, i.e. where we narrowly avoided busting through 10,000 on the Dow to the downside.One pundit has called the job of the fedwalking on a tightrope in a hurricane.  Indeed.Hyperinflation riskis one thing that I think is becoming a legitimate topic of conversation. For calibration, the Dow-Gold ratio has historically been as low as 1.0. We could see it again. Not kidding.  Run the math on that one for a moment and you will see the implied volatility associated with being on the wrong side of the inflation-deflation debate as policymakers run out of choices without consequences.Here a brief primer on “Stick Save” for the uninitiated:As for me, since I don’t have a ton of confidence in the stick-save as a strategy, I am sticking with domains and websites as aportable store of value that can preserve wealth.  Ask your investment advisor if he has a better idea. I don’t."
Hotels near Epik DevCon	24-Aug-10	"The Edgewater is now fully booked during theEpik Developer Conference— September 15-17.  We are on the hunt for more rooms and have secured 5 more rooms.  If you need assistance securing a hotel room, please contact Kristine Oliver — kristine@epik.com.   We’ll update this page as we secure additional group rates.Hotel 1000has 5 rooms at a $229 rate. This place is great — 3 blocks from Pioneer Square on 1st Avenue, and 2 blocks from the waterfront.  I stayed there for Fathers Day weekend.  There is a golf simulator in the basement that my 6 year old daughter and I tried out. It was ample reminder that running Epik is not compatible with learning golf. It was free and fun to try out nonetheless.  For reservations, attendees can call Katie McNulty, Reservations Manager at 206-315-1088."

Free domains — we weren't kidding	23-Aug-10	"Konstantin Kostov just picked up these 3 names, along with the indicated appraised values on Estibot:liposuctionsurgery.net    $7,300cheesepress.com    $8,800olympicbarbell.com    $14,000These 3 names were all Epik drop-catches from earlier in the year.   Our basis was reg-fee so it was easy to leave a lot of money on the table for the next guy.  We look forward to developing these for Konstantin.In addition, Konstantin also brought 7 of his own domains for a grand total of 10 developments.   Konstantin is delighted. I met him for the first time at DomainFest in NYC, and look forward to helping Konstantin build a valuable portfolio.Congratulations Konstantin."
.CO Development — All systems go!	22-Aug-10	"When the .CO TLD landrush began, Epik made anearly commitment to support the TLD.  Our caveat to the early developers was that we were uncertain whether .CO domains would get indexed or ranked.  While it is still early days, the indications aregood. Here are a couple of illustrative .CO developments that are now live.Sweaters.coWe did not have Sweaters.com or Sweaters.net in the Epik network, so when Nick Uva brought us Sweaters.co, it was an easy decision to take it on.   The site looks good and is getting indexed.SportsBra.coRecently, Kenny Hartog’sBra.nethas been at #1 or #2 on Google for “Bra” and #11 or #12 for “Bras”. It is a success story already. Monthly search volumes for “sports bra” are well above 100,000.  When Jun Du brought SportsBra.co to us, we were happy to take it on.In addition to .CO product portal developments, we have several .co geo developments under way.   We’ll report on .CO traction from time to time.   So far I am encouraged.  The search engine indexing pattern is fairly consistent from the initial sampling of .CO developments.   The sites do come out of the sandbox.  They index more slowly than .com or .net but theyaregetting indexed.  This bodes well for prospective developers who obviously are able to buy .co domains for a small fraction of the .com or .net equivalent."
Democratizing Dropcatch – Why we give away valuable domains for FREE	22-Aug-10	"While attending DomainFest, I received several unsolicited comments about Epik’s policy of giving away valuable domain names — words like “brilliant”, “clever”, “disruptive”, “game-changing”.  However, it was clear from the tone, that these comments were not always expressed with joy, notably by companies who are in the business of auctioning off names to the highest bidder.  So, what exactly are we trying to accomplish here?Traditional DropcatchWhen Ray King and Ron Wiener co-founded Snapnames in 2000, they invented the category of “catch and auction”.  Even today, long after Halvarez, the company still has a great business.  It has relatively high fixed costs, but also insane gross margins.  The historical challenge for this model is to get lots of bidders to participate in the auctions. This is where the business model gets more complicated. The more bidders, the higher the price.  The more successful Snapnames, Pool and others become at promoting their services, the higher the price, and the further out of reach domains become for bootstrapping domain investors who are confined to 2 and 3 figure bids due to economic realities. In a weakening economy, and with a shrinking pool of major wholesale domain buyers, there is an obvious tension that I don’t see getting resolved anytime soon.Democratizing DropcatchEpik’s dropcatch model is quite different.  We catch to develop. And we develop a lot — about 300 custom sites per week.   But did you know that every week, we give away domains for FREE to people who are developing on Epik? The logic of this approach is simple.  Our cost basis is reg-fee.  We want to build a community of developers who share our passion for building useful websites that make money for their owners.  The community of Epik developers keeps growing every day, in part because of our philosophy of leaving money on the table for the next guy.  By giving away a high quality domain for free, there is a high probability that the developer’s downside is fully protected by the resale value of the developed domain.  That’s it. Simple.Some recent catchesEvery day, Epik catches between 10 and 50 names. The average catch rate is on the order of 80%, through a network of direct registry connections.  We catch names that we want to develop, or that we think someone that we know will want to develop.  We don’t park. Period.   Here are some recent catches:DomainAppraisedValueAvgCpcAvg SearchVolumeDevelopmentDirectiondatacentersolutions.net3,0008.764,428Lead-gen sitelockablebox.com9402.053,567Product Portalpestrepellants.com6701.93393Product Portalmissiondesks.com1,0002.3725Product Portalbeadedsweaters.com1,3001.241,230Product Portalgolfmats.net1,8003.039,963Product Portalhypnotherapyweightloss.net1,9003.572,337Product Portalstretchcanvas.com2,0001.221,599Product Portalportableburner.com1,0001.251,230Product Portalhoodriveroregon.net1,1001.0314,883Directorytoddlerpants.com1,1000.981,968Product Portalterabyteharddrive.com1,5001.818,118Product Portalkiteaccessories.com6501.32885Product Portalrefurbishedvacuum.com7101.64319Product Portalgalvanizedfencing.com8301.22319Product Portalretractablebabygates.com5901.771,082Product Portalinexpensiveframes.com6401.82258Product Portaltroystorage.com7603.762,952Directorynewbornbabyclothes.net1,3001.468,118Product Portaldesignerbabyclothes.net1,5000.9660,885Product Portalsqlbackup.net7,8008.136,642Lead-gen siteoffshoulder.com2,5000.4612,177Product Portalnurseswatch.com1,3000.91885Product Portalhdmidvdplayer.net8400.7122,263Product Portalapartmentsfortworth.net8805.961,230Directorybachelorettepartylimo.com5603.32393Directorybarsclubs.net6000.616,642Directorybusinessinternetproviders.net3,90010.5712,177Directoryceilingfanbulbs.net1201.49725Product Portalcruisefromnyc.com7103.36590Directorymobilityscooterforsale.com5303.441,082Product Portalofficeshredders.net1,3005.042,952Product Portaloneshouldertop.com7500.91,230Product Portalonlinedegreeinaccounting.net1,20021.36393Lead-gen sitepapercupdispenser.com6201.792,337Product Portalstretchskirts.com7501.23258Product Portalsendflowersinternationally.com1,3006.92725Lead-gen siteturquoisebead.com2,0001.141,599Product Portaltroponin.net1,3001.3912,177Wikiwillsestates.com1,7002.88258Lead-gen sitewarehouseshelf.com1,6002.931,230Product Portalyentl.net1,4000.376,642Wikivideomonitoringsystems.net6707.29319Product Portalrestaurantnewyork.net2,8000.9349,815Directoryonlineparalegalprograms.net2,300212,337Lead-gen siteThis is typical of what we catch on the drop.  We have now been catching regularly for nearly a year with increasing efficiency.  If you are looking to build a portfolio of developed, income-producing websites, we have an ample quantity of raw land with which to do it.   You can also screen for dropping names using our free service atdomains.epik.com.  The bottom line is the same — if you develop on Epik, the domain is FREE."

Explaining Domains as an Asset Class to Finance types	20-Aug-10	"Many smart, financially-savvy people are not  informed about domain names as assets.  So, if your banker or financial advisor still does not get domains, here are the main points, in language that finance-types understand.Simply described, Domain names are the raw land of the Internet. And while the offline economy is shrinking, the Internet economy is not.  And in these uncertain times, there is even more compelling economic case for why one would want to own domain names:Domains can be priced and traded in any currency.Domains can be operated from anywhere.Domains can be owned by anyone, and even via anonymous proxy.Domains have essentially no counter-party risk.Domains produce recurring, passive income, particularly when developed.There is a rapidly maturing secondary market for domain names.Unlike Physical Precious Metals (PMs), domains are weightless.And unlike PMs, if a domain name “disappears”, you can find it!A balanced investment portfolio could easily justify having 10% of holdings in income-producing domain names. A portfolio of names including Tshirts.com sold for $1.25 million in New York on Wednesday.  Slots.com sold for $5.5 million earlier this year.  Yet, every day, about 80,000 domains are abandoned by their prior owners.Opportunities abound for speculative gain and capital preservation.  Educate yourself:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2HwPgmcvEM"

Called it: Sell stocks and bonds. Buy domains and websites!	20-Aug-10	"During a brief visit to New York City, I had a chance to visit with a number of Epik partners and clients.  Power-Developer, Kenny Hartog, kindly opened up his home for a late night visit following DomainFest.  During a far-ranging discussion, Kenny asked me about stocks.   He was surprised to learn that I own no stock and no bonds inanypublic company.Exactly one week ago, I posted in my blog that I detected an“inflection point” in the economic outlook. I further stated that the Double Dip in the US economy was already under way.   Looking at Thursday’s trading activity on the equity markets, I would say I got that one right —all 30of the Dow Industrials were down.The fundamental economic story is weak and getting weaker.  The available policy levers are not addressing the structural problem of unemployment in the Western economies. Beyond the troubling fundamentals, it is perhaps thetechnicalstory that is even more curious — something called theHindenburg Omen.To be clear, I am not categorically against stocks or bonds. In fact, I started trading equities when I was 12 years old.  However, from amarket timingperspective, I find it difficult to make a case for why anyone would want to be long on public equities right now.If your investment strategy requires you to continue to hold stocks, I recommend selling banks, insurance and consumer durables, and keeping energy, mining, consumer package goods, agriculture and telecom.  As for bonds, I don’t see how they go up materially from here.So, with that, I offer my free and unsolicited advice:Sell stocks and bonds in August, and buy domains and websites in September!Check out some of these confirmed low reserves for the September 16 live auction for income-producing websites:ComputerHardware.net–  $5,000UltrasoundMachine.com– $10,000SEO.mobi– $2,500AbdominalTrainer.com– $4,900HoodedRobes.com– $850BeachBags.net– $750Etc.Also, low reserves for developed premium sites that combine great domains with turn-key websites that are ready for entrepreneurial owners to take the businesses to a whole new level:HardDrives.com– $175,00Complain.com– $125,000.Slideshow.com– $1.75 millionMaid.com– $325,000Snoopd.com– $5,000This is just a small sampling. There will be a total of 100 live auction assets, and 200 extended auction assets. Pre-bidding starts August 31, and the live event starts on September 16 at 1:30 pm PST.  More details at theEpik Developer Conferencewebsite.    Look for more news in the coming weeks as we gear up for this exciting event."
See you at Domainfest?	17-Aug-10	"I am just boarding the plane here in Seattle for the red-eye flight into NYC to attend DomainFest on Wednesday. Looking forward to a great event.  If you are there and want to talk about domain development, drop me a note at rob@epik.com.  Looking forward to a fun conference.  Epik is sponsoring.Update on August 19.Just back from DomainFest.   Oversee-Moniker did a great job putting together a 1 day event which was widely attended and sold a number of significant domain assets.Jeff Kupietzky, CEO of Oversee, delivered an excellent opening address on the 5 Myths of Domain Investing.   It will eventually be posted for public view, in which case I would recommend giving it a look.  The auction also went off without a hitch.The only downsides of the event were (1) the Grand Hyatt had a complete lack of suitable open areas for peer networking which created for a lot of a standup meetings, and (2) the mid-afternoon breakout meetings could not possibly have been too fruitful for the folks that participated in these Mosh Pits inside of a jam-packed ballroom!Otherwise, it was a great, sold-out event, with a large number of new participants to the industry.   It is a tribute to the Oversee folks to see their commitment to hosting regular events that are cost-effective, informative, and well-attended."
Epik-Moniker Live Auction event on September 16 moved to larger venue and open to the public	17-Aug-10	"Media announcement of the Epik-Moniker joint auction event hasstarted earlier today.

Pioneer Award to be presented at the Epik Developer Conference	16-Aug-10	"One of the things that we get excited about at Epik is applauding the exceptional individuals that have made the domain industry what it is today, and who are continuing to shape it in the yeas ahead. In line with that, we are also pleased to start an annual tradition — The Pioneer Award.The recipient of the annual award fits the following profile:The Pioneer Award is presented annually to the one person or organization who most embodies vision, leadership, and courage in building a better Internet through domains.The annual award will be announced at theEpik Developer Conference.  As part of the award presentation, the Epik team is working on a video tribute to the individual that the conference committee believes is most deserving of this 1st Annual Pioneer Award.We are now just 4 weeks from the start of the Epik Developer Conference in Seattle.  We look forward to hosting a great group of intrepid internet entrepreneurs who share a passion for achieving financial independence through domain development.   We’ll continue to announce more news about the upcoming in the days and weeks ahead."

The Quest for Recurring Income	12-Aug-10	"Back in the good old days, domainer owners would buy a name, park it, and wait for the check.  During the 2008-2010 recession, that model largely broke down. Since then, we have seen a period where liquid domainers bought inventory from the illiquid domainers.  However, recently, domain traders are reporting that they are having a tougher time to move the inventory as they are selling to a shrinking universe of wholesale buyers who can choose from abundant supply.  It is time for a new model.Pain 2.0Back in September 2008, very few people saw the storm coming.  Tremendous wealth was destroyed in a very short period of time as the world endured the fallout of casualties (Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns), nursed the too-big-too-fail (AIG, Goldman, JPM-Chase, Citi, etc.), and sustained the walking dead (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). And with trillions of dollars of conjured liquidity, the financial system was able to step back from the abyss. Or so it seemed.Flash forward to Summer 2010. My personal view is that the Double Dip has arrived.  Not coming. Arrived.  Welcome to the recession that never really ended, otherwise known as Pain 2.0. And with that comes more uncertainty, more dog-eat-dog, and more pressure on household finances.  This is the highly regrettable reality of the leading economic indicators.  The ECRI’s leading indicators is flashing trouble: -10.3.% versus +10.8% a year ago. See the green line below.The 30 year US mortgage rate dropped this week to an all-time low of 4.44% — assuming you and yours have the balance sheet strength with which to secure said “cheap money”.  The notion of further debasement of the US dollar through the Fed’s Zero Internet Rate Policy (ZIRP) is nothing new.  Printing currency to buy treasuries, also known as “Quantitative Easing”, is also nothing new. AndRecord US trade deficitsare also nothing new and not going away. And the issue of structural unemployment is unsolved which means budget deficits as far as the eye can see.However, as an internet entrepreneur, the true canary in the coalmine for me was Amazon’s latest earning report, which I blogged abouthere.  They missed by a lot despite executing brilliantly in so many ways. Since then, the flurry of IPO filings (e.g.Demand Media… ),KKR’s cancelled offering, and Fortune 500 CEO “resignations”, all scream one thing: an “inflection point”. Add to that,Massive fires in Russia,epoch flooding in China,Fidel pontificating about the imminent risk of global conflict. What next?  It doesn’t matter.  The smart money is already heading for cover and for higher ground.What to do?Bootstrap BabyA double dip, should it indeed happen, does not mean that commercestops.  It means negative growth which in turn means that there is a tougher battle for a smaller pie.  This favors two types of people: (1) the deep-pocketed folks who can ride out the downturn, and (2) scrappy, nimble, adaptable people that can out-compete and/or out-innovate more bloated players.  Said another way, even an extended period of US/EU deindustrialization does not mean there are no opportunities to create value.So, welcome to the era of “You, Inc.”  If that concept sounds scary, perhaps the alternative of being singularly dependent on the generosity and well-being of your employer will cause you to reconsider.  The truth is that becoming financially independent is not really all that hard and is often less stressful than wondering if your job will be there in 3 months.   Becoming financially independent won’t happen overnight, but anybody with discipline and self-awareness can do it.Recently, Epik partnered with domainer Oliver Hoger to build a portfolio of mostly product portals.  Oliver is quite possibly the next Kenny Hartog. And by that, I mean an Epik developer whose Epik portfolio alone is a basis for financial independence.  Kenny and Oliver both work from their home offices, as do I.  They don’t have secretaries. Nor do I.  With low overhead, your new startup is almost instantly profitable. Overhead is overrated!A portfolio of Epik-powered sites, features low setup costs, and essentiallyno operating costs.  Acquire and Develop new properties when you have funds. Optimize and Sell existing properties when you don’t. You can do it.  Get startedhere.  Or come to theEpik Developer Conferencein September and the growing community of successful domain developers will teach you what you need to know and help you on your way."
The Chinese are coming	10-Aug-10	"Back in November, I blogged about what is sometimes referred to asThe Pacific Century.  There are a number of scenarios that could still play out that would make this not the case. However, the odds-on favorite to emerge as the next global economic super-power is China.  And right on queue, the Chinese are also becoming prolific global domainers.Chinese Investment — you ain’t seen nothing yetThe history of Chinese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has historically been dominated by State-owned enterprises.  However, in this next phase we are seeing a significant regulatory easing of outbound FDI controls, not just for enterprises but also individuals who have access to online payment platforms, credit cards and overseas bank accounts.  As China continues to increase its Foreign Exchange Reserve, look for more of these reserves to get promptly converted into hard assets.In recent years, a significant portion of the FDI has been in the form of acquisitions of arable land — notably in Africa and South America.  Some people call this neo-colonialism, only instead of having to conquer territory by force, or threat of force, in these cases, land is acquired from legal owners, and the right to use the acquired asset is protected by domestic or international rule of law. And with China racking up a$28.7 billion trade surplus in July alone, look for more cash to get put to work in the months ahead.What does all of this mean for ownership of the Internet?  Private ownership of the Internet is well-established.  If the Internet economy is going to be a significant foundation for the continued expansion of global commerce, it goes to follow that the most desirable raw land on the internet will also become contested territory.  And so, look for the Chinese to stake their claim on a territory near you.Chinese Domainers going global?Recently, I, and others, have noticed a trend.  Chinese domainers are aggressively buying domains on the drop.  One of the main themes is that these individuals have been buying the .com versions of existing China-based companies that are going global.  I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg.  The bigger story is only starting to unfold. Here are a couple of scenarios to look out for in the not-too-distant future.Converting dollars into hard assets:  I have long argued why Domains are better than dollars, includinghereandhere.  Thedecision by the Fed todayto continue the policy of loose monetary policy — loose for major banks at least — puts further pressure on dollar holdings to find safe haven elsewhere.  The Chinese are among the most aware of this because of their enormous holdings of US Treasuries.  The DXY dollar index is one to watch, particularly at levels of around 74 and 70. As the below chart shows, the DXY has never gone below 70.Direct export of finished goods to consumers:  The other scenario that I think is highly probable is direct sale of finished products via the Internet to consumers.   Consider for a moment whether you have ever talked to a live person at Amazon.com.  If you are like most people, odds are against.  So, if the consumer can engage in a direct transaction with Amazon.com, and Amazon is in the business of distributing product manufactured by others, at what point does the supply chain close the loop and start shipping directly to the consumer?  I believe that day is not far away at all. If that is the case, (Chinese) manufacturers of consumer goods will be looking for ways to take more direct control of the online retail supply chain. With Epik now powering more than 3,000 online stores, we are watching this area with great interest as we prepare to integrate dropshipping and e-commerce.Coming to Seattle in September?The upcoming conference and auction on September 15-17 in Seattle is a great opportunity for China-based Domain developers and investors to build their portfolios with income-producing properties.   Here are some key opportunities worth noting:The live auction event on September 16 will feature 100 developed websites.  The extended auction will feature an additional 200 developed websites.   These turn-key websites are fully operational and ready to go to the next level. Price points for turn-key sites are as low as $500.The domain swap event on September 17 is the domainer’s version ofRuilverkaveling, or land exchange, between domainers as domain owners optimize their portfolio to have more of what works for them, and  find a safe landing for the names they will never develop.Also, on September 17, there will be an opportunity for domainers who are long on domains but short on cash to put their domains to work by working directly with Epik to trade domains for development services, as well as finalize development partnerships that turn undeveloped domains into income-producing developed sites.And for the Chinese who plan to attend, we extend a heartyNi Hao, in advance and hope to see you in Seattle in September!  The early bird registration has been extended to this coming Friday, August 13 and theEdgewater Hotelstill has some discounted rooms available through August 16.  Registerhere."
"Seriously folks, who is dropping these?"	31-Jul-10	"One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.   So the saying goes.Seriously though, I am mystified that names of this caliber are beingdropped.  We are happy to catch them but it seems symptomatic of what must be a significant shift in domaining.  Domains that were economically useful during the parking era are no longer cashflowing.  A lot of development-worthy names are getting dropped.You can follow our daily drop catch onTwitterorFacebook.  Today’s drop-catch is summarizedhere.  Since we are catching these for reg-fee, we are happy to share them with  anyone interested in developing on Epik.  Contact me for details.And make sure to check out tomorrow’s drophere."
Clarification on $500 offer from Epik	30-Jul-10	"There have been some questions about our $500 incentive program for theEpik Developer Conference.Herewith, a few clarifying remarks:What is it?: As an incentive for conference registration, we added a $500 Developer Credit. This credit can be used for anyEpikorDevRichservices, including domain development and domain purchases.  The credit doesnotexpire.Who is eligible?:  The on-site conference has capacity for 150 delegates and we are reserving space for non-Domainers, notably VIP delegates from real estate and finance.  As such, we’ll limit the $500 Developer credit to the first 100 registrants.   Space is filling quickly so register soon.As for buying domains from Epik, here is where you will find them:Twitter/Facebook:  We are tweeting out the daily acquisitions here:https://twitter.com/epikdotcom. The tweets link out to Facebook notes pages which catalog the daily acquisitions.  We are seeing a fairly consistent 80-85% catch rate.  These domains are generally pre-approved for development.Stores.Epik.com:  This is a partial catalog of online stores, powered by Epik, that have been made available.  Most of the stores listed here are young stores, and many of them still owned by Epik so we will do deals.Domains.Epik.com:  This is our free site for screening drop-catches. I use this tool to screen names. We share it openly as a public service and encourage folks to backorder with us either through the form, or by sending an email to rob@epik.com with your catch list.  First come first serve with preference for existing Epik partners.EpikWiki.com:  This is the catalog of live Wiki sites, many of which are also linked with other sites in the Epik network.  A number of folks are using these Wiki to build starter content.  We think that is great.A word on pricing for domainsTo the extent prices are indicated, if you are developing on Epik and Epik owns the domains, the prices are negotiable. In fact, we are getting a reputaiton for giving away domains to people who are developing on Epik.  We think this is an important way we can help people to develop successful portals.  Let’s face it:Domain Selection is Destiny.A special thanks to our SponsorsThanks to everyone for helping to make this First Annual Epik Developer Conference a huge success.   I would also especially like to thank our Platinum and Gold sponsors,Moniker.comandGoDaddyfor being along for the journey.   We’ll be announcing additional Silver and Supporting sponsors shortly.  The generous support of our co-sponsors is what it makes it possible to give out the developer credit. I learned long ago that you make most of your money on the front end of any deal.  The decision to come to a conference is no different, and we are doing everything possible to make it as much of a no-brainer as possible!"
Test Drive a Directory	28-Jul-10	"Test Drive a DirectoryAs readers of this blog well know, Epik has developed several platform to cost-effectively create useful and profitable websites for the domain owners. The Epik | Directory platform is used to build out domains whose names can best be represented as a directory of information, whether is is a location, a category of people or things, or both. And as we expected, the interest and uptake of this new platform has been substantial. Epik | Directories are proving to be a major new platform for the creation of useful and revenue generating sites.We at Epik are so excited about our new directory platform that we want to spread the word even more. We want to make it even easier for site owners to convert their directory-related domain names into something substantially more useful and valuable than a standard parked site.Take a Test DriveSo now, Epik will automatically generate a directory site for you, and let you test drive it. For free. And getting started couldn’t be easier.Simply point the DNS records of the appropriate domains to NS1.EpikDirectory.com and NS2.EpikDirectory.com. Your site will temporarily resolve to a new “under construction” lander <include screenshot>, and shortly thereafter, your directory — automatically generated by our systems — will appear. It’s really that simple.TANSTAAFLSounds almost too good to be true. And, as as readers of Robert Heinlein know, TANSTAAFL (“There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch”). So, think of these auto-generated directories as an appetizer. By pointing your sites to the EpikDirectory DNS, we essentially turn your directory-related domain into a smart lander containing basic directory information on that particular locations and/or subject.However, these “lander directories” have some restrictions compared to our standard directory products, most notably:No customizationA complete directory implementation includes a custom logo and other associated graphics, color scheme, etc., as well as advanced search capabilities customized for the site’s subject area. “Lander directories” do not offer this level of customization; in this sense they are generic.Lack of rich contentComplete directories contain a much richer array of content, including pictures, comments, reviews, etc. Again, the more generic “lander directories” do not offer these.No monetizationThe site owner does not participate in any revenue generated by the increase in traffic to the site, or through any ads served by the site. They do, of course, reap the benefits of any increase in appraisal value due to increased traffic volumes created when moving from a simple parked site to a lander directory.So What’s In it for Epik?Lander directories are a wonderful way to see how turning your domain into an Epik Directory can drive traffic to your site.

Easy. Not Ugly.	26-Jul-10	"When we first launched Epik Wiki on July 4, I did not know what to expect in terms of user adoption.   Although it is way too early to declare victory, the early signs are encouraging as users embrace the platform and breathe life into domains that would have otherwise gone undeveloped.Case Study – A people site with a passionate fan editorEarlier today, I saw a good-looking Wiki get produced by a user. You can see it by visiting the site calledNicoMirallegro.com.  Who is this Nico guy?  Well, with more than 8,000 monthly searches, he has a lot of fans. We figured someone should build a fan site for Nico and picked up the domain. What we did not figure at the time was who was going to develop it.  The Wiki platform presented an ideal solution.In the meantime, a fan of Nico named Sara, came along to the Wiki site and added content. We then made her an administrator of the site so she has the option of collecting Adsense on the site should she decide that this is important.  She seems to take more joy from having a reason to interact with Nico to secure latest content. In other words, the motivation of a Wiki editor is notper sefinancial.  And with zero training or documentation, Sara created a useful site that others can help edit.Easy … not uglyThe bottom line is this.  Wikipedia goes out of its way to be ugly.   Compare:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_MirallegroTo this:https://nicomirallegro.com/Our challenge in creating a Federated Wiki platform was simple: Be Easy. Not Ugly.  So far so good.   The multimedia editor is at least as easy to use as Wikipedia, but the results blend multiple media formats which creates a richer experience.Since releasing the Wiki platform, we have had countless requests for features.  To be clear, this is never going to be a full-blown Content Management System. It is a Wiki. It iseasy.  That’s the point.  When it comes to a crowd-driven solution, it is has to be easy.Countermeasures for Link-spamThe Epik Wiki does offer followable links.  This makes it a natural target for link spam.  It is a reasonable trade-off if someone contributes useful and relevant content that they might backlink to one of their sites.  That would be a win-win.  What sometimes happens is an author will simply add a backlink to their commercial site with no editorial value added.  In that case, the link is going to be removed if not by us, than by the editors who engage with the site.Process-wise, when a new site is updated, we get a notification. In addition, anyone who signed up to receive news from the Wiki is also notified.   Over time, this builds into a following of engaged stakeholders who we believe will care if a useful Wiki is defaced by a useless link.  This crowd-based editing and policing is what ultimately makes it possible for a network of Wikis to scale.Which comes first the chicken or the egg?The classic challenge that the Wiki platform faces is how to engage the crowd. The crowd can’t engage if it does not know that a site exists. The search engines won’t tell the crowd that a site exists until the site has a critical mass of original content.  So, how does one breathe life into a new Wiki besides aggregating existing content?  We are working on scalable approaches to engage the initial base of prospective Wiki contributors.  From there, the engaged community of topical enthusiasts can expand, and become self-policing in terms of what content is fair game or not.  And all of a sudden, everyone isJimmy Wales."

They missed the analyst estimates and the stock tanked 15% in after-hours trading.  Domain owners with product category names, take note, as I believe this has implications. I previous blogged about Amazonhere. I continue to follow Amazon closely, not just because they are a Seattle-based internet success story, but because they are a bellwether for web commerce. When Amazon catches a cold, it is meaningful because it suggests something is afoot.The results were good, but below expectationsToday, after the US markets closed, Amazon came out with theirlatest earnings report. The company earned $207 million  ($0.45/share) on $6.57 billion in revenues.   The  analyst consensus was at $0.53/share on $7.16 billion. For a public company with an out-sized market valuation, that would be a …. BIG swing and a miss!    Why the shortfall versus forecast? Well, the analyst expectations were a bit giddy, for one thing. However, could it be that Amazon’s ability to squeeze stakeholders is finite? I think so.Symptom #1: Google is KingmakerI have a theory that Google has become a significant threat to Amazon’s business model.  Google is increasingly not ranking Amazon product pages at the top of the SERP. On any given day, IceCreamMaker.com is #1 or #2 on Google.  At Epik, we see the same with other fast-risers likeIceCreamMaker.com,GirlsSwimwear.com, andBra.net but also on the vast network of long tailcategory namesthat are getting traction likepsylliumhusk.comandreloading-press.com. As more competitors compete for these top category terms, Amazon will have to battle even harder to maintain a top position in organic search. Easier said than done when operating on such vast scale.Perhaps more importantly, what is the incentive to Google to rank an Amazon page? As near as I can tell, there is none whatsoever. If Google sends a consumer to Amazon, that consumer has just been trained to go shopping at Amazon the next time they are wanting to shop online.  It is foregone conclusion that Amazon’s pages will be less favorably ranked than they are today. The writing is on the wall as there is a growing number of domain developers who are learning affiliate marketing, dropshipping and e-commerce. Some of these new entrants are going to execute well. CSN Stores and Hayneedle proved the model but neither has scaled it to 100,000 stores.  And they won’t!Symptom #2:  The affiliates are waking upAffiliate marketers are increasingly aware that Amazon is paying outlowerandslower.  Our affiliate network pays out an average of3 times higherthan we were earning when we used Amazon feeds.  In the short-term, it makes logical sense for Amazon to (1) increase chargebacks, (2) discount click volume and (3) delay payouts. However, affiliate marketers are generally not idiots, and will eventually wake up and smell the raw deal. When they do, they will come up with counter-measures. Epik already did. Sure, there will be a new generation of affiliates, but if enough of the top-ranked competitors defect from Amazon, that spells trouble for Amazon.Symptom #3: The consumer is still hurtingAt the end of the day, Amazon’s success is tied to a robust consumer economy.  This may or may not be in the cards.  Of note, the ECRI publishes the best non-tampered economic indicators that I have found.   The leading indicators are not good and flashing double-dip recession. See the green line below.WWAD  – What would Amazon Do?So, the operative question for domainers is this?  Given Amazon’s balance sheet strength, and the implied risk of 100,000 category-defining domains being powered by something other than Amazon, when will Amazon embrace a domain strategy?  I don’t know if Amazon has a domain strategy. I do know that the price of not having a domain strategy is going to go up rapidly in the months ahead.A look ahead atEpik Stores(formerly known as Product Portals)Luke Webster, EVP Operations of Epik, is normally based in Sandpoint, Idaho where we operate our call center and fast-growing production center.  This week, Luke spent 2 days in Seattle working with the team here for strategy meetings.  A core purpose of the meetings is the planned migration to Dropship, and eventually, e-commerce for many of our online stores.  Luke’s previous work in the e-commerce field, as well as the work of Epik’s sole outside investor,Tal Moore(Founder ofGumballs.com) has taught us that there are categories where there is as much as 90% gross margins — a far cry from the $0.18 average CPC currently being earned on our affiliate networks.  Stay tuned."
.CO TLD Domain Development	21-Jul-10	"The .CO sunrise and landrush has generated a tremendous amount of interest.   One of the main challenges for past TLD launches has been the anemic level of actual development, which ultimately resulted in the irrelevance of the TLD — .ws, cc, .mx,  .whocares?   In the case of .CO, a lot of the best keywords have now been taken.  So, what’s different about developing on the .CO TLD?.CO domains cost moreIt is one thing to spend $7 a year to be wrong. It is a whole different story when you are spending $30 per year.  The clock ticks faster when you are burning $30 a year for the privilege of finding out whether you bought into a failed launch.The .CO is not going to be a big typo story.Typographic studies don’t suggest that .CO will be a big type-in story, unlike .CM, which profited handily from the wildcard pattern.  I routinely type .CM but honestly can’t ever recall typing .CO.  I know I am not alone on this point. So, anyone counting on big type-in traffic from their .CO name is probably in for a rude awakening.The .CO means business. Or does it?The fate of a TLD is largely a function of thebrandstory behind it.  Just as .ORG is associated with not-for-profit, it goes to follow that .CO should be about business, as the near-cousin of .COM  (or commerce).  What is the fundamental value proposition positioning of the .CO brand?  Not clear yet, but from the registrations I have seen so far, .CO is about business and not about individuals.  For example, as of this moment, nobody own BarackObama.co.  That makes sense to me in spite of the search volumes..CO could still be a busted launchWhile I am not a huge fan of TLD proliferation, I do think the .CO has legs. However, do not underestimate the task ahead.  For the emerging promise of the .us TLD, I believe we have just witnessed what is likely a failed .TEL launch despite the single best TV campaign for a new TLD that I have ever seen.  If you missed it, enjoy:And for the record, we did register DomainDevelopment.co plus a few others.Epik embraces the .COWe would be delighted to see the .CO succeed.  If you bought a .CO TLD, the good news, through August 31, we will give you a $30 discount on development of your .CO TLD. In other words, if you manage to get a .CO TLD, and develop on Epik, congratulations you got the domain for free and have a year to find out if the .CO is going to be the hit that I think it can be.  And if it is a hit, I would say, give a big hat tip toLori Anne Wardi— from about day one, she has been relentless in breathing life into the .CO story."
"Webcast debut on Wednesday, July 28 at 2 pm ET"	20-Jul-10	"Owen Frager is pretty irresistible when he wants to be.   When he asked me to do a webcast, I was thinking something small scale and low profile.   It looks like it will be a well-attended broadcast. I am looking forward to the event and hope you will join us for what should be informative session including an announcement.If you have not registered, please visit here:https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/484594659This will the first time that I do a webcast, but hopefully it is still a fitting capstone for Owen’s impressive run of 40 webcasts.

Every dog has his day	18-Jul-10	"Creative dealmaking is something that I enjoy, particularly when it gives Epik the opportunity to work on a domain that might otherwise be out of reach for development due to the circumstances of the owner.  Sometimes it means bringing together a 3rd party. If it is a deal that makes sense, Epik can help make it happen. And sometimes we get lucky.Last week we were able to finalize a deal with domain portfolio owner Harry Daskal.  The deal involved one of the most complete portfolios of names related to puppies.  It is a natural choice for building on ourdirectory platform.   The portfolio includes more than 1,000 pet and dog related names, including some of these gems below.DomainAppraisalSearch volumeAvg CPCAd competitionboxerpuppies.com45,000204,6000.42highgermanshepherdpuppies.com19,000204,6000.76highgoldenretrieverpuppies.com7,900204,6000.43lowdog-kennels.com920204,6001.72lowhuskypuppies.com17,000136,4000.46highpomeranianpuppies.com31,000136,4000.68lowlabradorpuppies.com20,000136,4000.41lowrottweilerpuppies.com28,000136,4000.49highenglishbulldogpuppies.com4,700112,2200.59lowcockerspanielpuppies.net1,40091,7600.47highpuppytraining.net3,30075,0201.26lowdachshundpuppies.net54061,3800.5lowfrenchbulldogpuppies.com3,60061,3800.49lowbichonfrisepuppies.com2,40050,2200.43lowyorkshireterrierpuppies.net1,20041,0440.66lowchihuahuapuppies.com7,40033,6040.45highlabradorpuppiesforsale.com41033,6040.4highdogpetsupplies.com10,00033,6041.71highpapillonpuppies.com10,00027,5280.51highWe initially put these domains on the Epik Wiki platform in order to start the indexing process following an extended time on a parking network.  In about 2 weeks, we’ll start rolling out directories of breeders and service providers.Other recent examples:Drew Sharma owns VideoProduction.com.  Now that is a gem.  Here is ourdomain appraisal.   The always energetic Friend of Epik, Todd Reum, brought us the opportunity to develop it.  Drew is looking for $100K for the domain. The domain appraises for considerably more.  If someone wants to buy it from Drew, Epik will pre-approve the development with an exclusive for the video production category.Shai Neubauer brought us the domain Location.com.  I first met with Shai more than a year ago at deli in mid-town Manhattan. I won’t forget that meeting.  Although we did not get a deal done then, we got a deal done earlier this month. The timing is perfect as we are integrating Location.com into our directory strategy in a way that I am personally excited about.  As a result, it made sense for us to take this one on a no-cash basis.  We will release the first phase in August.Challenging times call for creative solutions."
Easily … the easiest .info play ever	18-Jul-10	"I am pretty sure this is the easiest domain development ever.  It is also the cheapest — you can build a live SEO-worthy site forunder $1by using a .info domain and powering it with a free EpikWiki.The .info TLD is perfect for Wikis and Godaddy lets you register them for $0.89 for the first year.  Starting a little more than a year ago we registered a few thousand .info names and began experimenting with usingDevHubto power reference sites.   Contrary to rumor, the .info domains indexed fine to the extent that there is worthwhile content.  Even though we won’t renew them all, we successfully verified that you can develop a .info that will rank in the search engines. Of course the same works for other TLDs.Here are the steps for building your $1 Wiki site:1. Register a .info with high search volumes, e.g. 500+ exacts.   There is no shortage of topics — people, places and things — with high exact search and for which a dedicated Wiki community is justified.  If you are not ready to take on full development, you can build a free Wiki instead.2. Set the DNS to:NS1.EPIKWIKI.COM and NS2.EPIKWIKI.COM3. Visit the new site. This activates the Wiki site, which can take a few minutes to complete.  If you have an identity.net account, you can login and edit the site.4. The WHOIS registrant will receive a confirmation of the new Wiki as well as add your Adsense publisher ID.  The site will be listed in the Epik marketplace.  As your traffic grows, the valuation of your site increases.That’s it. You are done.  If someone edits the Wiki site, you are notified via email along with anyone else who signed up for the newsletter for that site.  And with the Wiki marketplace, you now have 1 full year to find a buyer who will pay you more than $1 for a site that requires zero training to manage.Importantly, the model scales.  A developer can start with a $100 domain development budget. With that $100, you can have 100 sites. You now have one year to sell any one of them for $100, or generate $100 of ad revenue across 100 sites, in order to recoup 100% of the original investment.Easy."
Introducing Epik Marketplace for Wikis	18-Jul-10	"TheEpik Wiki solution has grown quickly since the announcement on July 4.  Our Wiki platform provides afreesolution for building sites that are crowd-edited.  It is perfect for How-to sites, People sites and Reference sites. And now, we go one step further by offering aWiki marketplacewhere the Epik-powered sites can be bought and sold.Why do we need more Marketplaces?The remarkable success of Flippa.com is indicative that there is market demand for a place to buy and sell sites. However, if you have ever bought a site there, you realize that this is not an efficient marketplace and there is nothing Flippa can do to solve it.  Why? For anyone looking to build aportfolioof income-producing sites, there is an inherent scalability challenge. In particular, every developer builds on a different platform. This means that every new site purchase means integrating assets that were inherently incompatible.  Surely there is a better way.By integrating site development with a marketplace, it becomes possible for domain developers to be able to manage integrated portfolios without having to worry about the back office requirements for operating the sites. At any given time, there will be domain developers who need to sell as well as domain developers who want to grow their portfolios. If developers have a shared platform, the “integration” of the acquired site is a non-event.  This is what Epik-powered marketplaces will be working to solve.  In other words, once a site is purchased, the acquired SITE is added to your account, including historical data about the site and control of all of the content.For a preview of the EpikWiki marketplace, you can visithere."
The Epik Ecosystem at work	9-Jul-10	"One of the unique aspects of buildingEpikis the “ecosystem approach”. Specifically there is a unifying architecture that connects the expanding network of Epik-powered sites.  We are 5% of the way through the journey and I could not be more excited about what is coming along.What do we mean by “Ecosystem”Ipreviously bloggedabout the Epik ecosystem.  In that post, I used this visual to begin to explain how the pieces are being assembled to create a more intuitive user experience for consumers as they navigate from site to site.Like building a city from the ground up, everything is easier for the developers when there is a unified approach to shared services like sewage, water, electric, zoning, and standards for where to find what.  In the next phase of the web, Epik believes that the people who own domain names have a key role to play in building a better web that is more intuitive and more user-aware.Epik’s implementation of the ecosystem vision is still evolving but the notion of an interconnected network with horizontal components has been a core design principle from the start.  As the various Epik-powered solutions now begin to get serious momentum, we expect that the network effects will begin to build rapidly.  Here are a couple of simple examples of the ecosystem at work.Product Portal APIThe recently announcedEpik Wikiplatform has been quite popular since going live last weekend.  One reason it is popular is that we give the domain owner 100% of the revenue share from Adsense. So, what is in it for Epik to host these site for free and give 100% of the Adsense revenue to the domain owners?  Well, for one thing, Epik gets the opportunity to add contextually relevant backlinks. So, if you create a Wiki about lawn care, Epik might add a backlink to an Epik store that sells equipment for lawn mowers.The API is very simple to use:https://api.epikstores.com/search_domainsThis returns the default amount (5) of random domains.https://api.epikstores.com/search_domains/amount/8This returns 8 random domains. The number after the term “amount/” dictates how many domains are displayed.https://api.epikstores.com/search_domains/keyword/bedThis search will look through the main text, tabs, and popular searches of every domain for the term “bed”. The default number of results it returns is 5. If it cannot find enough domains that contain “bed”, it will fill up the rest of the 5 slots with randomly selected domains.https://api.epikstores.com/search_domains/keyword/bed/amount/8This would return 8 domains. It will return as many as it can that include the keyword ‘bed’. If it does not find enough to fill all 8 slots, it will fill the rest with random domains from the Epik Product Portal network.Sample Results from an API call<summary>"
Start the conversation with an Epik Wiki — it is free	4-Jul-10	"Happy Independence Day.One of the early promises of the Internet was that it would lead to a proliferation of independent media targeting an ever-expanding array of topics. On the surface, the 1st amendment would appear to be alive and well. Yet the web is still dominated by a collection of top 100 sites that dominate traffic on the web and, by inference, these sites also dominate the resulting message.  Even Wikipedia has become mainstream and has embraced centralized policy for content management rather than the federated and democratic model with which is was first conceived. Today, on this annual celebration of the Birth of the Republic, I am pleased to announce the release of Epik’s Multimedia Wiki — a free hosted content management system for Wiki-based content.JFKSpeech.com seems like a fitting tributeI have owned the domain nameJFKSpeech.comfor some months. I picked up the domain on the drop in January. When I acquired it, I had a clear image in my mind that it should be used for a tribute site to an exemplary Citizen, Patriot, and Orator.  During his Presidency, JFK took on some audacious challenges, not the least of which was taking a public stance on the existence of secret societies in America. It is with this speech, that the JFKSpeech.com begins. Since there are people far more knowledgeable about JFK than I am, it makes sense to hand it over to the community.  As such, feel free to add to theJFK SpeechWiki.Wikipedia was a good idea.  It is time to federate it.Wiki sites can be used for any topic. It is ideal for situations where thecollectivehas more access to relevant content than any singleindividual.  Wiki technology has not substantially evolved since the first major Wiki platform, Wikipedia.  In particular, most Wiki platforms fall short when it comes to integrating multimedia. The Epik Wiki platform merges the notion of a community-edited Wiki with versatile site editing features more typical of content management systems like WordPress.  Each Wiki is hosted on its own domain, and combine features forcontentandcommunityin a single site.In the below example, theBubbaWatson.comgolf tribute site was auto-generated by theEpikWiki platform.  The resulting site is editable. The Wiki generator provided a kick start to the site. After that, registered users take over the editing of the site.  And for those of you who don’t know,Bubba Watsonis an up and coming golfer with a killer drive off of the tee. While I am not much of a golfer, I fully appreciate the athletic challenge of hitting a ball straight for 400 yards! I also appreciate that there are a lot of folks who know a lot about golf that don’t know much about how to create and manage websites.  This is where the notion of a hosted Wiki is helpful.In short, Domainers can help those with knowledge bystarting the conversation.  If you are sitting on domains that correlate to a topic suited to community-based authoring, today is your lucky day.  In particular, all those folks sitting on .org domains that map to search-worthy topics, the Epik Wiki platform offers a turn-key solution for breathing life into domains that would otherwise go unused, and also undiscovered by the major search engines.Setting up an Epik-powered Wiki site is free and could not be easierTo create a Wiki site on Epik, follow these steps:1. Change your DNS to NS1.EPIKWIKI.COM and NS2.EPIKWIKI.COM.2. Once the DNS has propagated, visit the site and your Wiki site will start building. Wait a minute or so and the site is ready for use.3. To edit the content, just register or login and you will see a full-featured WYSIWYG editor.The resulting site has a few interesting characteristics:The initial sites are auto-generated. While not perfect, it is quite good in terms of matching the domain to relevant content with which to start a Wiki.All Epik Wiki sites utilize theIdentity.netsingle-sign-on.   Once you are registered, you can login and edit on any site in the Epik network that is user-editable.Comments that are made on any Wiki site are also syndicated toComments.com, a searchable repository of comments across the Epik network.Although it is still early days for the Epik Wiki platform, it fits into Epik’s larger plans around making domains as relevant as ever in the next phase of the Internet. It is also fitting to announce the Wiki platform on Independence Day. I invite you to give it a try and give us feedback on how you would like to see it improved.Independent Media in the US is a Right and a Privilege —  neither should be taken for grantedThe constitutional rights that we all take for granted in the United States are subject to interpretation. The guardians of these constitutional rights are the Justices of the Supreme Court. If you ever readThe Federalist Papers, you may recall that the Founding Fathers embraced  “Separation of Powers” vis-a-vis The Executive Branch (President and Cabinet), The Legislative Branch (Congress) and The Judicial Branch (Supreme Court).  By design, the Supreme Court is theoretically the equal of the other 2 branches.The Judicial debates around Freedom of the Press (First Amendment) and the Right to bear Arms (Second Amendment) are heating up again.  Specific to the 1st Amendment, the Internet has an important role to play in promoting the free flow of ideas.  As a publishing medium it is unmatched for efficiency. However, the internet of today still only does a modest job of helping readers to figure out what content is authoritative enough to be worth reading. This is where innovation is needed — and soon.Ultimately, the web will either become good atself-regulating, or it will becomeregulated.  The internet is too important to the functioning of our connected society to treat it with “benign neglect”. The architects of the next web have a shared duty to preserve the Founding Fathers intent of “Freedom of the Press” while preserving accountability for individual expression. Anonymity has its place but to the extent that it is abused, we invite regulation. Personally, I prefer self-regulation and personal accountability."
Epik and Moniker/Oversee join forces for live auction event at September 16 DevCon	2-Jul-10	"Over the last several months, I have had the privilege of working with several of the talented folks at Moniker and Oversee.  In addition to confirming Moniker as the exclusive auction partner to manage the upcoming sale ofPatents.comat theAugust DomainFest in NYC, Moniker is now also confirmed as the exclusive auction partner for theEpik Developer Conferencein Seattle. The live auction event will be held onSeptember 16, 2010from 1:30 pm with remote bidding via Proxibid.Partnering to build and sell Domains with AssetsThe term “Domains with Assets” is Moniker’s term for describing a developed website.  At Epik, we tend to view a website as an online business.  The challenge for a buyer of an online business is how to manage hundreds or even thousands of online businesses. That would be near impossible,unless, those businesses could be managed on a unified platform.  This is exactly where the auction/sales partnership between Moniker and Epik is an obvious win-win.Epikis building a unified platform that allows an investor to manage their domains across the entire lifecycle:  Acquire, Develop, Operate, Sell.  At the core, Epik is a Domain Development company. We provide a growing number of managed technology platforms which make it easy to develop and maintain profitable websites.  The addition of Moniker’s ability to sell these developed websites provides Epik’s Developer Community with access to a scalable and proven sales team.As forOversee/Moniker, not much introduction needed here. These guys have become a titan of the industry with an enormous domain portfolio, one of the most complete product lines, a talented leadership team and thebluest of blue chipbackers.  Though leadership transitions from Founders is not with risks or challenges, I think we are beginning to see the emergence of an exciting next phase for Oversee under Jeff Kupietzky. And in case you missed it, Jeff crushed it yesterday on CNBC:Auction Inventory coming soonLooking ahead, we expect to finalize the joint list of websites for the September 16 auction by the second half of July.  Pre-auction bidding will begin during August.  Look for further details in upcoming posts and on the Epik Conference Program page which will be updated regularly with emerging details about the program, venue, accommodations and the auction itself. To be included in the September auction, a domain should either be a developed website, or a super-premium name that Epik has confirmed to be ready for development by the prospective owner."
Epik Developer Conference – The Domain Developer event of the year	28-Jun-10	"The Epik Developer Conference is shaping up to be a must-attend event for anyone interested in learning about domain development.  We are putting together what should be an enjoyable and rewarding program.  This post provides an update on the Conference Venue and some of what we have planned for the delegates of the 1st Annual Epik Developer Conference.Conference Venue Selected — The Edgewater Hotel in Downtown SeattleTheEdgewater Hotelis Seattle’s only true Waterfront hotel.  The venue combines Pacific Northwest style with the modern amenities of a downtown waterfront hotel.  Delegates will enjoy an ideal environment for learning about latest developments and building partnerships. The Edgewater was also the site of this month’s Search Engine Strategies Conference.Room rates for delegates have been negotiated to $199 for city side deluxe rooms, or $229 for the waterfront full view premium rooms. I checked the hotel venue on Friday and can say the extra $30 is worth it for the waterfront full view.Work and Play on the Seattle waterfrontThe program will start with an evening reception at The Edgewater on Wednesday, September 15 and ends mid-day on the 17th.The conference on September 16-17, and a Live Auction event on September 16 will be be conducted in the Main Ballroom of The Edgewater which features a panoramic view over Seattle’s Elliot Bay.After the Live Auction on Thursday, September 16 delegates and spouses will be treated to a 3 hour cruise, open bar, and a 4-course Pacific Northwest menu.The hotel is also walking distance to the Seattle Space needle, Waterfront attractions, and the Pike Place market for anyone who feels the needs to take in more of the full Seattle experience during their visit.

Temporary Insanity: We just bought our first .mobi	24-Jun-10	"I never thought I would do this but I guess there is a first for everything. Luke Webster — SVP Operations at Epik, and President of the DevRich business unit — convinced me that we should buy SEO.mobi.   I trust Luke’s instincts and am rolling with him on this one.The logic of owning SEO.mobiThe business logic here is in three parts:Mobile SEO will likely emerge as a category: There is little debate that SEO is a strategic keyword. The SEO profession is far from done growing. We also anticipate the mobile search will have its own unique challenges with regards to SEO.   So, the logic here is that SEO for mobile search will be a somewhat unique competency for which a generation of service providers will emerge.The SEO keyword is competitive and worth owning:   We already provide SEO services for our own fast-growing content network, and for which we are buying a lot of  outside SEO services. As such, we could even trade SEO.mobi for a bundle of future SEO services from someone whoneedsto own this name. For us, it is nice to have.The price was right:  The deal included a package of 4 other telecom-related names: PhoneAccessories.com, RFShields.com, Cell-Accessories.com, and PhoneWholesaler.com.  The combined price was fair with appropriate discounting for the longevity risk for the .MOBI TLD.All that said, worst case, I am going to plead temporary insanity on this one. So, save the below “Certificate of Insanity” for later.  It might come in handy!"
The Bottom Line	24-Jun-10	"I will turn 43 years old in August. I now have the gray hair, receding hairline and sports injuries to prove it.  Along with the bad stuff comes also the good stuff: wisdom, accountability, reputation, and enduring friendships.  Whether you call itKarma,win-win,orwhat-goes-around-comes-around,I have learned that it pays to be nice.Ebay is an interesting case studyTo an extent, empowering a generation of internet entrepreneurs is what drives me. When I look at how many people make a living selling on eBay, I think to myself “how cool is that!”. This was a company that started as a hobby and blossomed into a massive global enterprise that created an enormous network of entrepreneurs, the vast majority of which are engaging in legitimate transactions.  The company built an entire business model around personal accountability and reputation. If you are a reputable seller, you get more business and with less transactional friction. It pays to be nice.At Epik, our goal is to empower thousands of entrepreneurs to become financially independent through domain development.  However, beyond helping people to make money, I am intrigued by the idea of creating a community of like-minded individuals who also want to be part of something bigger — something that can actually make the Internet work better.  The folks who I think share this vision of the future are what I call “Friends of Epik” or FOE. When I first started using the term, even I thought it seemed a little corny. However, it fit the spirit of what we are doing. After all, life is too short not to have friends.The FOE LetterPart of making the “Friends of Epik” scalable has been a Friends of Epik letter, or FOE Letter.  This letter is in the form of an email update that I write personally. I send it out a few times a week, often at night. In this letter, I share details about what we are working on, what is working, and also what isnotworking. I also publish the list of domain names that Epik acquired recently and which we make available on buyer-friendly terms.Beyond communicating transparently, we try to proactively seek the win-win even if it is not “profit-optimizing” in the short term. A few random examples:Earlier today, Friend of Epik, Mike Ray, part of the prolificAlbuquerque Epik mafia, bought the domain name stainlesssteeltable.com from Epik. He paid $249 for the domain with a product portal. The Estibot appraisal here is $9,000.  The name was a drop-catch for Epik and so it was easy to find the win-win here.A number of folks have bought names from us that for whatever reason have been sandboxed by Google or otherwise underperform.  In good faith, we  do further work on the site. If we still can’t get it right, we’ll buy the name back for what the client has into it, or offer a comparable name in trade.A lot of folks in this industry are what I call “Long on Domains. Short on cash”.   In these cases, we have accepted domain names in trade for developing their sites.  We have donemanyof these deals. It is always a win-win and gets folks who were losing money on renewals once again cash-flowing from their developed sites.We pay out on the 20th of the month whereas our affiliates usually pay us at closer to day 60 or later.  Is there a risk that we get some charge-backs from our affiliates? Sure. Does our CFO like this practice? Not really.  We do it because it is the right thing to do. We do it because it rewards our partners’ success in a timely manner.Occasionally we will miss our deadlines for delivering a developed website, e.g. because of a technical issue or because something slips through the cracks.  If we screw up, we’ll take the hit. For example, we will offer to develop an additional domain for free, do some free SEO work,  provide supplemental content, etc.This may seem a little novel but clearly it is not. If you have shopped at Nordstrom, Costco or LL Bean, you get it.  These companies make an inherent assumption that people are not evil.  In other words, in business, as in life, you can usually turn the other cheek. I find that 9 times out of 10, it will work out in the long run.  This is not a license to be asleep in the switch or to be a sucker. Rather it is a starting point for how I approach any new acquaintance.  Trust but verify.Being a Friend has been a win-winWhat has Epik gained in return for being a Friend? Lots.People are building their entrepreneurial ventures on our platform.People tell us when we are screwing up and give us advice on how we can be more successful.People bring us deal flow and refer new business.People trust us with their money, usually paying in advance for development.People offer to come work for us, with us, or be acquired by us.I could go on. I think the point is clear. It pays to be a Friend.So…Thanks for reading and thanks for being a Friend."
Why Epik Stores outperform Amazon and Shopping.com powered stores	19-Jun-10	"A number of folks have asked about why our Product Portals perform as well as they do. How can it be a that a site makes little to nothing on a parking network, Amazon store, or Shopping.com store, and then months later on Epik dramatically more? There are a number of reasons that are worth understanding for anyone considering how to monetize product category domain names.Amazon is an oligopoly — and they pay their affiliates accordingly: low and slowAs a consumer, I love Amazon as much as the next guy. They have simply nailed it.  However, as an affiliate marketer, they are burning the bridge with publishers. Amazon’s market power is impressively dominant to the point of being an oligopoly.  As a result, they dictate the price of traffic by lowering revenue share, shortening cookie life, excluding transactions,  and extending payment terms.  Sure,historically, Amazon paid well.  No longer. Today, the only folks that paylowerthan Amazon is Shopping.com.To Amazon’s credit, they made it incredibly easy to build stores around their Amazon affiliate feed with structured data, simple widgets and a robust API.  As a result, large numbers of solutions emerged, including do-it-yourself solutions, that are built around Amazon’s feed. Associate-o-matic is among the better known solutions.  Beyond Amazon’s rapidly plummeting payouts, there are two major problems with these Amazon-centric stores:The content is not original:  Publishers have reported difficulty in maintaining indexing and ranking for sites that relied primarily on the widely syndicated Amazon affiliate content.  The search engines recognize the content as not original and have little reason to rank it.You are training consumers to go to Amazon: If you build on Amazon, the consumer checks out on Amazon. Congratulations, you have just trained another consumer to shop at Amazon.  Amazon has little incentive to buy the resulting site. After all, they arealreadygetting all of the traffic along with the repeat business.The one big downside of not relying on Amazon’s feed is that it is a lot more work to find products that match a given domain name.  This is a short-term downside that is more than offset by the long term upside of sourcing products from affiliates that pay a competitive rate for traffic.Epik’s network-wide average CPC in May was $0.18The Epik portals are monetized on a pay per click basis. A typical visitor will actually click on several product listings, each one of which is treated as a click. As a result, a single visitor can rack up several dollars worth of revenue. During May, the average revenue per click was $0.18.  I have seen Steve Barclay’sSpoons.comrack up some of the highest revenue per visit of any site on the Epik network.  It had 8812 visits in the past 30 days. You can track the progresshere.Building a proprietary affiliate network is hard work.   In addition to having secured one of the highest paying CPC networks for online retail, we also pay out on the 20th of each month and withincreasing revenue sharesfor higher performing portfolios.   A big reason why we were able to build this out as quickly as we did is because of our exclusive relationship with Seattle-basedWishpot.com— a group that I and others venture-backed in 2007.  When Epik partnered with them, Wishpot had already spent 3 years and significant resources to build a shopping comparison network with high revenue share. This capability is a core component of the Epik Product Portal platform.Looking ahead, because of the rapidly growing transaction volume, Epik’s ability to negotiate with affiliate networks is improving.  We are in discussions with additional affiliate networks that are likely to push the average yield into the range of $0.24-30 per click. The final step will be to enable advertisers to directly buy CPC from the network. So, for example, we often hear from advertisers who want to list their products on our sites.  At the moment, we can sell advertising and sponsorships. In a few weeks, we’ll release technology previously developed by Wishpot that will allow advertisers to upload their product listings and pay for traffic on a CPC basis.Bottomline:  Where’s the Beef?When evaluating solutions for product portals, looks beyond the homepage and the short-term SEO tricks. Pay particular attention to how the resulting traffic is monetized in a way that actually benefits the publisher of the site as opposed to the downstream seller of the product.  In other words, “Where’s the Beef?”."
Show me the money	17-Jun-10	"When we launched Product Portals,  we did so with a model of a 50/50 revenue share.   However, with sites likeIceCreamMaker.comracking up $1,200 in monthly net, and Epik-developer Kenny Hartog now operating more than 500 Epik-powered sites, the monthly revenues quickly become material. It is time for Epik to up the ante.Introducing increased revenue shares for Product PortalsWhen we started building portals, the idea of 50/50 revenue share made sense to us. We figured most folks would do as we do and want to re-invest what they earn.  What we discovered is that different network partners have different objectives in terms of allocation of operating cash flow.Many Epik network partners are very clear in their objective in terms of monthly operating cash flow. For example, a number of independent portfolio managers are looking for $10,000 in monthly cash flow. The sooner they get there, the sooner they quit their day job. Makes sense to me.With the new revenue-share model, the more your portfolio makes, the more you keep.  It is all out there — 100% transparent.  Here is what it looks like:Monthly net($)Rev-share(%)Payout($)1,00050%5002,50055%1,3755,00060%3,0007,50065%4,87510,00070%7,00015,00073%10,95020,00077%15,40025,00080%20,000Introducing 100% Revenue Share MinisitesIn addition to improving payouts on Product Portals, we have also been taking a close look at our Minisite offering.  For sophisticated developers who are doing things like traffic arbitrage, the economics of revenue share can become material in the planning on where and how to build.  Minisites that Epik produces now have the option of using the owner’s own native ad feed or Adsense Publisher ID in order to capture 100% of the advertising revenue.If you were looking for a good reason to come build with Epik. Here are two more reasons!"
Domain Greenhousing	13-Jun-10	"In aprevious post, I compared domain development to farming.  Even baseball uses the term “farm team” to describe the place where you incubate up and comers. While the idea of “domain farming” is certainly not unique, Epik’sexecutionof the domain farming metaphor is definitely unique.  A key component of the domain farming process is the initial steps that turn into a viable website — a step I call  Domain Greenhousing.Planting in June — better late than neverWell, the rain finally stopped in Seattle after record rainfall for the past month.  We live on a small lake and I have never seen the lake level so high in June.  This weekend my daughter, 6 year-old Kamryn, and I planted the garden.  Although my wife, Jill, and I have 5 kids, Kamryn is the only one that actually enjoys puttering around the garden with Dad. For the rest, an invitation from Dad to spend time in the garden is not high on the list of the kids’ favorite things to do.  As a result, it is pretty much Dad that is working the “back 40”.  Fortunately, I really enjoy it and now I finally have an enthusiastic sidekick who enjoys it too.Planting in June is of course  late. The trouble is that in Seattle the growing season is short which means planting outdoor from seed is not really an option — particularly this year with an extended rainy season. Seedlings are the way to go. Propagating a new seedling from seed, cutting, or tuber, is easy to do if you know how to do it. In college, my Freshman dorm room at Cornell was a total greenhouse.  College roommate, Joe Forkey, was remarkably tolerant of the green thumb. Mid-way through Freshman year, he realized  that (1) I wasn’t growing any cannabis — not that the RA would have had a problem with that, and (2) trading plant cuttings was a pretty effective way to meet girls!Domain GreenhousingThose young plants that you get from your local home improvement store or nursery of course from greenhouses.  The greenhouse has a pretty good business model and the margins are high enough to compensate both the greenhouse operator, the retailer, and everyone else in between.  The tomato plant for $4.95 came from a seed that cost less than a penny.  The fruit-bearing strawberry plant for $7.95 came from a runner or root that cost perhaps $0.05. Add the cost of grow lights, soil, water, fertilizer, containers, and physical transport and the field-ready seedling is still under $1.In other words, greenhousing is a win-win for consumer and greenhouse operator.  The consumer pays more for a viable plant and still gets to reap the harvest.  The greenhouse operator got paid a margin for selecting viable seeds, propagating them, and getting the plants ready for planting in the open field.  The same model can apply to domaining.  A domain greenhouser can select viable domains, bring them to life following something like the following process:Select the seed: Every day, some 60,000 to 80,000 domains are dropped.  Epik acquires 10-50 names per day on the drop.  We even built afreetool for screening for dropping names for a number of criteria.  Try it here:https://domains.epik.comPropagate the seed: Every week, Epik produces 200-250 custom websites. Last week alone we produced 190 custom product portals.  This is a tedious task for which we have developed an elaborate supply chain that extends to 4 continents in order to build beautiful sites at an unbeatable price.Plant the seedling:  When a site is released to production, we are catering to many different audiences, not the least of which is the search engines whose algorithms and human reviewers determine where the site ranks.  There are no sustainable short-cuts.Fertilize and water the seedling: Once the site is live, add content, backlinks, social bookmarks and provide responsive customer service.The greenhousing metaphor may not work for everyone, but it makes sense to me.  Over time, we bring these young sites to market.  Though still a work in progress, you can see a preview of the site marketplace here:https://stores.epik.com/Think of DevRich.com as a greenhouserAs bloggedpreviously, Epik recently acquiredDevRich.com— not to be confused withDevHub.com, a company that I backed as an angel investor and continue to serve as Director on the board.   DevRichbuilds out sites on a turn-key basis whereas DevHubgives you a tool so you can build sites yourself.  Both are useful but they serve different needs.  DevRich goes from seed to thriving plant.  The pricing for custom site production is unbeatable:Luke Webster, President of DevRich, is getting the job done.  I have seen first-hand that  DevRich custom sites work. The sites get indexed and ranked. Domain owners keep 100% of operating revenue using their own Adsense accounts. In other words, with DevRich, there is 100% transparent reporting and pay-out of all revenues even though DevRich is operating the sites.Breathing life into a new domain is a skill. Sure, you can learn it yourself, but the infrastructure for doing it with scale would be expensive to develop and operate.  One of the main reasons for acquiring DevRich was a recognition that many domainer owners would greatly benefit from a managed greenhouse solution. A greenhouse operator like DevRich plugs that development gap very nicely.Transplanting the SeedlingsOnce a site begins to take root in terms of organic traffic and monetization, it is time to look at the long-term growth strategy for the site.  This is where the rest of Epik’s platform capabilities come into play.  While most domain portfolio owners cannot custom develop their entire portfolio, the DevRich platform is an ideal solution for bulk development of custom sites.  The concept and vision for the grown site is already identified at the seed stage. So, when the site becomes viable, the path for growth is already mapped out as opposed to being an after-thought.Last but not least, one exciting feature of the DevRich-Epik integration is that Epik will credit 100% of any DevRich-related cost towards further development on Epik.   In other words, the domain owner who spends $19.95 to build a DevRich site and $4.95 in monthly site hosting gets 100% of that development and hosting cost applied to any future custom development even though the domain owner banks 100% of the revenue directly into their own Adsense account.  It makes for a pretty easy decision if you ask me.Come farm with us.  For more information about building on DevRich, contact Luke Webster — luke – at- devrich.com."
Video Portals – a sneak peak at what is coming next from Epik	2-Jun-10	"The recent TechCrunch Disrupt conference revealed something interesting:FunnyOrDie.com already makes tens of millions of dollarsin what is likely high margin revenue for hosting video humor.  This has interesting implications for domain developers as the world moves rapidly towards web video as a source of information and entertainment. So, how can domainers participate in the explosion of online video? Read on.A look back: Yahoo had their shot with Broadcast.com but YouTube dominates web videoWeb video was destined to be huge.  The ultimate on-demand video entertainment made possible by abundant choice and instant access through a plurality of web-enabled devices.  The 1999 peak-of-the-bubble deal by Yahoo toacquire Broadcast.comfor $5.7 billionseemedinsane at the time, andwasinsane.  Google’s $1.65 billion deal to acquire YouTube in 2006 also seemed insane at the time but wasnotinsane.  Subsequent entrants including Hulu, Veoh, Ustream have all placed large bets on various approaches to aggregating and delivering video.The net of all this is that we are all watching a lot more online video. This trend is far from over.  The upcoming launch ofGoogle TVwill make it even easier to bring video to the widescreen in the living room — the preferred viewing platform for many. The future implication is that internet video will finally be coming into the living room and onto your mobile device — whether the cable and satellite TV companies like that idea or not.At Epik we are big fans of segmenting online markets with “long tail portals”A key theme of Epik’s development approach is in developing the long tail of the web.   This is made practical by search engines which make it easy for consumers to discover the exact match of what they are looking for in a website that caters to that specific need.Product Portals:Product Portalsare what I call “segmented Amazon”.  If you are in the market for an Ice Cream Maker, you could go to Amazon, or you could go directly toIceCreamMaker.com. By the same token, Google could decide to rank Amazon’s all-things-to-all-people  site, or it could rankIceCreamMaker.comwhich is increasingly tailored to a very specific audience. What we are seeing is that more and more long tail segments are top-ranked not by all-things-to-all-people sites but rather by niche sites that focus on those segments and are bringing a focused value proposition to those segments.Directory Portals:   Directory portals are essentially what I call “segmented WhitePages and YellowPages”.   The model here goes beyond the model of a simple Directory listings, but also tailors the functionality to the expected call to action.   For example, if someone is searching for Dining options in New York onDining.com, we can infer that you would like to make a reservation. However, if someone is searching on CosmeticDoctors.com (coming soon) for a cosmetic surgeon, we can infer that they are looking for examples and testimonials about the doctor’s work and qualifications.These models for niche media are working.  Product Portal are now up to 1300 portals with 150 new custom portals coming online every week andoperatingrevenue up 100+% month-over-month.So who is segmenting the YouTube model?I am pleased to report that Epik has been hard at work at solving this issue by creating a network of Video Portals that map domain names to specific topics.  For anyone with .TV domains wondering what they are ever going to do with them besides pay renewal fees on parked domains, this should be particularly welcome news. Here is a preview of what is in development.How do Epik Video Portals work?The core of the system is what we callChannel Builder—  a full-featured and proprietary platform for aggregating video from across the web using an intelligent approach that filters for relevance and quality.  The resulting site is one that combines the three elements that we think make a viable site: Content, Community and CommerceContent: Videos:  High quality content organized around semantic themes.  Users can also upload original videos.Community: User comments and ratings, combined, Q&A, with social syndication.Commerce: Integration of Product Portal feeds for relevant products and, coming later this year, a marketplace for used products.The platform is built using the latest technologies for rendering videos across multiple platforms and devices.  We piloted use of Silverlight technology onSlideshow.comand will be using it again here.VideoPortals are a platform for what I call “Winnable niches” in videoThe opportunity here is not just to create online video portals for the obvious segments like “French cooking” and “Kite surfing”. The Video Portal Platform also opens up the opportunity to create niche segments that are ideal for the web. A few examples to illustrate the point:DingDongDitch.com— I picked up the his name on the drop.  It is an ideal name for aggregating this silly type of prank video. There arethousands of videoson YouTube alone that fit this genre.   People absolutely watch this stuff, and contribute more of same. There is definitely a mobile angle here …. not that I condone it.MotoCrash.com: If you missed the Daytona 500 this weekend, the highlight for many was a spectacular airborne crash.  Motocrash.com will aggregate motor crashes.  Google the term “motor crash” and you will see nobody dominates the search term. That’s an opportunity for aggregating videos like this one.As you can see, the opportunity exists for hyper-segmentation of video as online video fragments into niches that bring together content, community and commerce.   We believe domains will play a key role in this logical evolution of online video.What’s the deal?Similar to the model forProduct PortalsandDirectory Portals, Epik charges a one-time setup fee to produce each video portal and shares 50/50 in the operating revenue.  The setup fee is pretty close to the actual cost to develop and operate the site long enough to get the site to build sustainable organic traffic.  The planned cost to produce video portals is $749 per portal.  Prior to the official launch, we are offering video portals for just$499to the intrepid early adopters who order before June 30.One further advantage of being an early adopter on any Epik Premium network is that we try very hard not to have duplicate sites within any network. So, for example, it is unlikely that we will have more than one video portal about any specific topic.  The logic is simple — as with Cable Television, there is not much point in having blatantly similar channels.  At the end of the day, there has to be meaningful differentiation and segmentation, even when it comes to the long tail.We are having a lot of fun building this new Video Portal Platform (VPP) and look forward to sharing it soon to power a whole new type of online media.  If you are interested in learning more about it, contact me at rob -at- epik.com."
Epik | Directories: A New Path to Revenue	28-May-10	"The Epik Product Portals have been a huge hit, with over 1200 portals already in production. For names likeIceCreamMaker.com, theEpik | Product platformis an excellent way to increase the value of the domain and tap into the search volumes that would otherwise never come to the site. But, of course, not all domain names are so product-centric; many names with high exact search volumes are better suited for directories of businesses or places. They require a different platform.Last year, Epik rolled out a first generationdirectory platform. It offered fairly rudimentary business listing and the ability to add articles and videos. However, the ability to offer more attractive layouts, customized searches by business type, and, in general, a greater sense of depth to the information, was more limited that we liked. So, we want back to the drawing board. After months of development, we are delighted to announce our next generationEpik | Directory platform. Or, more accurately, three new Directory platforms.1. Service provider directoriesService Provider Directories list businesses that offer services to consumers, such as restaurants, hair salons, doctors, etc. On these sites, visitors can get the information they need about the provider so that they can decide whether to eat at that restaurant, select a new stylist, etc. The directory provides a list of businesses, and, for each business, a detailed profile page that describes their location, services, hours of operation, etc.A business can also create additional profile pages for each of their employees. A hair salon, for example, can create separate pages detailing each of their stylist, their specialties, etc. This enables users to not only explore whether they want to go to that salon, but also to help them determine which particular stylist is right for them.A service provider’s profile can include not only the usual text information, but also videos, photos, reviews, etc; the same is true for the staff profiles as well. There can also be a hierarchical relationship between these pages and their content. So, for example, a salon could create a gallery of all the hair styles created by their staff, but the gallery on the profile for an individual stylist would only show the haircuts that he/she personally created.As with most Epik sites, we leverage our platforms such as Comments.com, Questions.com, and Identity.net to create aggregated, cross-linked, and original user generated content as well as single sign on. And, because scheduling an appointment or a reservation with a service provider is such a common requirement, we will soon be rolling out the ability for these service providers to offer online appointment scheduling through integration with Appontment.com.Service providers can claim or create their business listing. Many of the platform’s capabilities are available for free through our Basic tier of services. More advanced features such as profile customization and online appointment scheduling, will only be available through higher, fee-bearing Premium and Pro tiers. Consequently, the directory platform offers several ways to generate revenue from a site.2. Proximity directoriesAnother type of directory is one where the primary concern, is where something is. For example, consider a directory of wifi hotspots or emergency rooms. The user wants a map of the nearest solution to their needs, and usually not much else. And so we come to the second type of Epik directory, in which the user interacts with the majority of the site information through an interactive map. To be sure, more detailed information is available, but the emphasis here is on where something is, not a detailed exegesis.Another difference between proximity directories and service provider directories is who “owns” the information. For a restaurant or hair salon, it is important to their business that they claim and control the content of their profile, the photos of their facility, etc. The tiers of service give them greater and greater control over that information.However, in the case of the proximity directories, the data is more suitable for crowd sourcing. If, for example, someone discovers that there is a new public wifi hotspot available at the corner of Fifth and Main, they can add that to the site, and other users can review and vet that information. In other words, the community becomes the driver of the site’s information in a way that is inappropriate for a directory of business, who must necessarily control their information more closely.  The explosive success of Foursquare.com is a good case study of how this can work very well.3. Geographic directoriesLast, but not least, are more general directories of people and business, but oriented around a particular geography such as a city or town. These directories are much more horizontal in nature, as opposed to the vertical nature of the service provider directories, and are analogous to a local phone book’s white and yellow pages.Tying it all togetherAs a parallel development effort to our three Epik | Directory solutions, we will also be releasing soon a unified master directory under the name TelephoneBook.com.   This master directory of contact information opens up the potential for creating a network of networks, including the possibility of aggregating foreign phone directories that adopt the unified framework for directory management.  As the web data becomes more structured through the incorporation of semantic technologies, this becomes the obvious evolution of phone directories.Getting started with Epik | DirectoryWe offer any of the three types of directories in whatever combination of subject and geography is appropriate.  For example:Dining.com          MontereyRestaurants.com          SeattleSushi.comWiFi.com          ParisWiFi.frAs for pricing:$999 for vertical directory, e.g. Dining.com$549 for a geo directory, e.g.  Seattle.com$249 for a geo-vertical directory, e.g. SeattleDining.comEveryone at Epik is excited about the new directory platforms and their ability to drive traffic and multiple streams of revenue for these types of domain names. We look forward to helping you build out some of your domains on these new platforms."
Epik acquires DevRich.com — Luke Webster joins Epik as SVP Operations	26-May-10	"I am pleased to announce the completed acquisition ofDevRich.com— an innovator in the area of mass domain name development.  As part of the transaction, Luke Webster, President of DevRich will also become SVP Operations of Epik.  Luke will continue as President of DevRich, which will operate as a division of Epik.Automated website generation is not a sustainable practiceOne of the things that we have learned at Epik over the last year is that automated website generation does not work over the long term.  The search engines are simply too smart and ultimately clients get what they paid for — not much. If you, or your vendor, produce a large number of sites without the benefit of human editing or original content, your sites will eventually be banned by the search engines.  In other words, the robo-content model does not scale and inevitably becomes a victim of its own (short-lived) success.Another major challenge for the traditional providers of low-end content services is that there is usually no “migration path” beyond the “starter site”. If the site starts to get indexed and ranked, then what?  If the content is weak, the bounce rate will be 80+%, and the “online debut” will fail.  When a site starts to get ranked on a term with search volume, the site owner has a finite window — measured in days or weeks — to deliver a more compelling user experience.  To do that, there has to be an integrated plan for moving beyond the starter site once the site gets traction. That is the missing link for anyone operating a network of “farm sites”.What about Custom sites?  Custom Product Portals, Minisites, and Directory Portals do work — done properly, they often work very well in fact.   However, they are not free. For example, at Epik, there is a $249 setup fee for a customproduct portallikeIceCreamMaker.com. There is a $999 setup fee for aDirectory portallikeDining.com. This is the one-time cost to get a custom site designed, launched and ranked.  The investment is entirely justified but it is not for everydomaineror for everydomain.What did Epik accomplish by acquiring DevRich?First and foremost, we added a talent team, led byLuke Webster.  Epik is well known for responsive customer service. As the Epik business has grown, my personal capacity to be “traffic cop” on new projects will eventually hit a limit.  Luke is a strong candidate to run “air traffic control” for Epik, working closely with other team members likeJohn Lawlerwho has done a tremendous job producing 100 custom product portals each week. DevRich also brings a call center operation that will play a key role not only in providing expanded inbound customer service for Epik, but also allows us to introduce inbound call processing for sites that arehostedby Epik.Second, we added competency in the area of building out original sites on WordPress.  This fits with our own growing capability to use and extend WordPress as a content management system for site development.Chathura Bandara, who leads the offshore team in Sri Lanka, will now report to Luke. For clients, this means onshore account management can be combined with the superior cost structure of a technology-enabled workflow that uses offshore fulfillment where it makes sense.Third, we added project management capacity for expanded production of custom Minisites.   Sample sites being worked on this week, includeSushi-Menu.com,New-Homes.com, andRental-cars.com.  In addition to using commercial WordPress modules, these Minisites are being equipped to adopt unifying components from the Epik platform such asIdentity.net,Comments.com,Questions.com, as our next-generationDirectory framework.Why this deal made senseWith DevRich, a customer can efficiently take 100 domains out and see what hunts.    The track record for DevRich has been consistent and the customers who have embraced it are pleased with the result. While this is not a substitute for comprehensive development, it is a scalable and cost-effective place to start.   Here are some representative examples of what DevRich produces for its lowest cost solution:legalaidattorneys.comappeallawyers.orgdclawyer.nethydrogencup.comseejamaica.infohhoelectricgenerator.comdenverlaborattorneys.combl.com3gPhones.comwannalead.comFrom the above list, the site 3GPhones.com is a good example of one that should be built out since the potential is large due to the high number of related searches.Getting Started with DevRich.com and EpikIf you have a portfolio of names that you want to develop, the easiest first step is to send us your portfolio. You can send itrob -at- epik.comorluke -at- DevRich.com.   At no cost to you, we’ll review the portfolio and recommend a capital efficient strategy for developing the portfolio."
"1st Annual Epik Developer Conference — Sept 15-17, 2010 in Seattle"	19-May-10	"I am delighted to announce the First Annual Epik Developer Conference. The conference will be hosted in Epik’s home town of Seattle from September 15-17, 2010.Client Summits are an important growth driverAs many people in the industry know, prior to starting Epik, I spent 8 years building a company calledGlobal Market Insite(GMI). Thanks to the diligent effort of a talented team, GMI grew ~100%per yearfor 7 straight years. In 2006, GMI was #93 on the Inc 500. I was named Entrepreneur of the Year in the same year. Shortly thereafter we completed one of the largest venture financings of the year, raising $35 million from 3 top private equity groups. That is “hypergrowth”.The foundation for hypergrowth was laid way back in 2000. That was the year we hired a talented founding team and also when we hosted our first client summit. The summit was held in the city of Vienna, Austria. It was a one-day event that was scheduled around a major industry conference. Many of the attendees of that event not only became loyal clients, but also many of them became friends, and business partners — both with GMI and with each other.The lesson I learned from this phase of building GMI is that client and partner summits are an important part of building a strong foundation for growth. Our mission at Epik is clear: we are here to create value for our Network Partners. If, in a few years from now, we have enabled 1000 domain entrepreneurs to build out 100 of their most worthy websites, we believe that we will have created a lot of value for our network partners, and in the process will hopefully have built Epik into a great company.Save the date – September 15-17, 2010The full program details are being finalized for what should be a worthwhile event for anyone serious about Domain Name Development. The Epik DevCon will be an opportunity to both learn and socialize. Here are some of the themes we are working on, internally and with outside experts who are participating in the event:Meet Epik: Overview of the Team and Strategic PartnersDomain Industry OutlookStrategy Update: What is Epik doing and why are we doing itAcquire: Acquiring Development-worthy Domains without breaking the bankDevelop: Developing sites that rank with search engines and win with consumersOperate: Content development, Monetization, SEOSell: Selling Developed WebsitesClient case studies: Case studies with real data that show you who is profiting on Epik and howDevelopment Update: New product announcements and Preview of upcoming productsLow-reserve Auction of Developed Websites: We will announce our Auction Partner soon and hope to conduct the first live auction of developed websites powered by Epik at the conference.RuilverkavelingSwap meet: Trade domains and with other Epik Network MembersDiscussion and Q&A: Open discussion with Network Partners about the future of our shared missionPlay and NetworkThis conference is not just about work.On the play side, we are putting together a social program that should be a lot of fun. We have hired an Event Planning consultant to make this 1st Annual Epik Developer Conference an event to remember.Max Ciccotosto (CEO of Epik partner Wishpot.com) is influencing venue selection and the social program. Max was single for a lot longer than I was and was quick to volunteer for the Program Committee.Weather-wise, mid-September is normally a great time of year to be visiting Seattle. Yes, it does rain here, butrarelyin September. And if there is interest in a Spouse program, we’ll put one together.Conference CostThe objective is to make the conference as affordable as possible. Epik partners with 20+ Network sites receive one free registration for the conference event. A registration form will go online next week with deep discounts for earlybird registration.Hope to see you in Seattle in September."
Bob Parsons: Tear Down Your Privacy Wall	16-May-10	"I first began using Domains By Proxy from Godaddy in 2009 after the strong encouragement from Epik’s Account Representative at Godaddy.   In most cases, the product was free, and otherwise near-free at $0.25 per year. For anyone considering Domains By Proxy, I would advise you to steer far clear of it.Chronology of a raw dealWhen I first began using the Domains By Proxy (DBP) product in May 2009, the cost was effectively zero, and the business logic of holding some names via proxy made enough sense that the consequence of trying it was tame enough.  The account representative in Executive Accounts also assured me that it could be removed at any time.On June 21, 2009 , I asked for privacy to be removed on all of Epik’s domain names.  It never got done.  Multiple reminders later, I was told Domains By Proxy had been completely removed from our domains. Come to find out on March 1, 2010 that onlyhalfof the proxies were removed.  We now have a slew of domains  up for renewal which are protected by DBP — and it is no longer free. Moreover, DBP will assess fees for processing written correspondence sent to the DBP mailing address.Nowthe only way we can remove Domains by Proxy is to go through a tedious manual process to remove Domains By Proxy. Across thousands of domains, that is just not an option. Godaddy management knows this full well. According to the Godaddy sales representative, the company deliberately removed the feature for bulk removal of the Privacy product. Are you kidding me?Moreover, if we remove the Privacy, we also reset a 60-day registrar-lock, making it as inconvenient as possible to transfer a name out before the name either expires or has to be renewed. On multiple occasions, names that would have been transferred out to new owners at other registars were renewed due to some combination of registrar lock or wanting to avoid navigating the Domains By Proxy maze.Pick your poison: Free Crack or Roach MotelThere is not much debate that Godaddy’s marketing practices are brilliant.  They routinely push the envelope for acceptability. The main envelope pushed to date has been one of sexual innuendo.  Domains By Proxy goes too far in making it even more difficult to transfer domains out of Godaddy while racking up additional fees for a service of questionable utility.Now, I am an avid student of marketing models.  I have two theories on the marketing model that Godaddy was seeking to emulate when they developed the go-to-market strategy for Domains By Proxy.Free CrackThe Roach Motel:  You can Check in but you can’t Check out!Godaddy’s unofficial workaround for getting rid of Domains By ProxyMeanwhile, on this past Friday, the Account Representative in Executive Accounts suggested a work-around.  Here are the steps:1. Create a new Godaddy account.2. Push thousands of names into the new account — but be careful to leave the WHOIS details the same as this will reset the registrar lock.3. Call him back to “Merge the accounts”. It may take a day or two.I should do these steps because Godaddy deliberately removed a feature that makes it practical to remove Domains by Proxy from thousands of domains without having to manually do this one step at a time ?Bob Parsons:Are you kidding me?Take down your Privacy Wall!"
Fingers in the dike. Gold fingers.	13-May-10	"As expected, the run for the exits appears to have started as the global fiat currency regimes begin to crumble — starting with the Euro.  Dealers for physical gold and silver bullion have been reporting capacity shortages for months now.  This week’s explosive jump in gold to all time highs suggest that other durable commodity assets — including premium domains — should follow.The Virtual wants to get PhysicalTo understand the magnitude of the problem with physical bullion, keep in mind that there are some reports that physical gold has been levered as much as 100:1. In other words, for every ounce of physical gold, there may be as many as 99 paper ounces that lay claim to that same physical ounce. Think of it as fractional reserve banking on steroids.The use of levering is also what had made it possible for traders to take very large short positions. Like other commodities, it has historically not been common to take physical delivery.  Rather it was normal to hold the commodity in its paper-equivalent form.  After all, physical anything has to be securely stored, and in the case of precious metals,  if it “disappears”, there is no paper trail to get it back!What is going on now is a battle between the highly leveraged shorts and the increasingly finite available supply.   As more owners take delivery, the supply that can be leveraged goes down.  The largest of the shorts may well have bet their entire existence on containing a run on physical gold (and silver). The stakes could not be higher.A Gold Moonshot and a Speculative attack on the EuroThe interesting development this week was the$1 Trillion Eurodefense fund announced last Sunday before the markets opened in Tokyo on Monday morning.  Speculators smelled a turkey shoot and have been shorting the Euro all week.  The price of gold in Euros is a good indicator of what happened.This is the price per ounce, denominated in Euros. However, the real crux of the problem is thatvirtualgold is priced the same asphysicalgold.Virtualgold can be created by shortingphysicalgold 100:1. While virtual gold is still available, physical gold increasingly is not.You can see the problem very clearly at the micro level. Talk to your local coin shop. In fact, these dealers have known about this problem for months.  Hence the deafening din of “Cash for gold” everywhere you look.Houston…. we have a supply problem.A long legacy of asset inflationThe banking community uses the term “Hawk” to describe a central banker that is quick to act on signs of inflation.   A “Dove” describes a central banker that has an “accommodative” stance towards inflation.  Quantitative Easing — the creation of money by buying debt with newly-fomented debt —  would be considered highly Dovish.  Fed Chairman Bernanke is Dovish.  The term “Helicopter Ben” refers to Bernanke’s academic banking concept of dropping money from helicopters to stimulate the economy out of Depression.Before Bernanke, we had Alan Greenspan.Alan Greenspan’s tenure as Central Bankeris legendary. It was also decidedly Dovish.  Greenspan presided over the biggest financial bubble the world has ever seen, starting with his appointment to Fed Chairman in 1987. One of his first moves was a massive liquidity injection in 1987 in the wake of the Long Term Credit Management bailout. Greenspan went on to serve a record five terms during which we had record wealth creation.Dovish tenure notwithstanding, what is interesting is that decades ago Greenspan had some pretty Hawkish ideas. Here is a quote that is widely attributed to Alan Greenspan way back in 1967 — long before Bretton Woods (1973):In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value. If there were, the government would have to make its holding illegal, as was done in the case of gold. If everyone decided, for example, to convert all his bank deposits to silver or copper or any other good, and thereafter declined to accept checks as payment for goods, bank deposits would lose their purchasing power and government-created bank credit would be worthless as a claim on goods. The financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves.In other words, abrogation of the Bretton Woods agreement — the unilateral decision by the US to take the dollar off of the gold standard — was one ballsy banker move. It worked. However, as you can see from the 1967 Greenspan quote, the central bankers were knowingly playing with fire.Implications — It is approaching “too late” for gold. It is not too late for Domains.The bottom line is that the central bankers know the score. Increasingly the public does too.  Paper metals are not really a viable hedge, and physical metals have their challenges. This is why I am increasingly convinced that domain names for wealth preservation makes sense. Here’s why:Rare:  There is a significant but finite number of development-worthy com and net domain names.High value to weight: Domains can be easily transported — virtually and in real-timeTraceable:  There is only one of each name.  It is impossible to “counterfeit” a domain. If your name goes missing, there is a process for recovering it.Intrinsicvalue: Domains are the raw land of the Internet — the increasingly dominant platform for communication, commerce and community.This is not to suggest that domains be a primary store of wealth, though for many domainers that is probably the case. The point is that high quality, professionally managed, domains are a viable component of a balanced investment portfolio."
Breaking news – Slots.com goes for $5.5 million	12-May-10	"It has been confirmed from two authoritative sources that Moniker soldSlots.comfor $5.5 million.  If this does pan out, it will set up a big week for Moniker auctions.  Epik also hasWiFi.com,Karate.com,HardDrives.comandHobbies.comas premium “domains with assets” in this auction.  Congratulations to Buyer, Seller and Broker."
101 New Product Portals Released for Week 22	10-May-10	"On the weekend, Epik delivered another 102 custom product portals.  In this post, I share some examples of why I think this is a pretty strong set of product portals that we are excited to be building.A few point worth noting about the portals of week 22:An initial baseline of Alexa rank is reported here so you can follow the progress using publicly available data.  I will be curious to see which sites end 2010 with the highest Alexa rank.  One contender iskids-bedding.com. We sold this one to Epik client Mike Morton for a great price.  He should do well with it.My favorite site to look at isEngravedFlasks.com.  Loren Splawn bought this one from us for a great price.  I was happy for him when he bought it. I am even happier for him now that the site is live.Many of the sites occupy what I call “Winnable Niches”. A good example iskoaguitar.comwhich we are building for Bill Eisenmann (aka NameClerk.com). Another good example isWallStencils.comwhich we build for James Stafford who already operates thewildly successfulOil-Price.net.  (note the hyphen folks)Speaking of hyphenated names, the sleeper of the week may beEspresso–Machine.com.  We picked this one up on the drop and built it for Stefan Schaer.  I have seen IceCreamMaker.com rise steadily — and already on track to do $5K profit per year.  High end kitchen appliances are a natural for online retail. I like Tony Lam’sYogurtMaker.comandToasterOven.comfor the same reason.Most of the sites below are client-owned.  What is notable is that there has been trading of developed sites.  Epik often facilitates these transactions as a professional courtesy to our clients. We don’t actually take a commission for matchmaking.Each site is actually a business on its own journey with more content and more functionality on the way.  Some of the sites will be re-sold before they become significant businesses.  However, knowing the owners, I expect that most will operate for many years as operating businessesDomainKeywordsAppraisedValueInitial

Are we having fun yet?	6-May-10	"The volatility in the financial markets today was breathtaking.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average came within a few points of triggering the 1000 point circuit breaker before snapping back.  Within a few minutes of trading, fortunes were made and lost. I expect we’ll eventually find out who was on what side of which trade. Then again, we may not.Today’s financial market movement hurt peopleZeroHedge covers the day’s eventshere.My personal theory is that this was a designed program trade designed to wipe out a bunch of people.  Among the victims was anyone with large short portions on Apple (AAPL) or long positions on Accenture (ACN).   Apple allegedly traded at$100,000per share today — it closed at $246.Accenture allegedly traded at $0.01 — it closed at $41.09.At one point even P&G’s stock was down more than 30% intra-day. That is ridiculous. P&G is a buy-and-hold, amply liquid, and classically defensive stock. It got roller-coastered today.In a casino, you at least know the theoretical odds. If there is unrestricted rogue program trading, and you happen to have a stop-loss, you get stopped out at some nonsense price point.  Ironically, today was a day, that it paid NOT to be wearing a seatbelt! Are you kidding me?  This is getting positively surreal.Personally, I own no equities other than the equity in privately held companies where I know the management team. The public equity exchanges have become a turkey shoot for program traders.  When even quality companies like P&G can be flogged, things have clearly gotten out of hand.As Iposited on April 28,  the VIX volatility index was artificially low.  Here is what happened over the last 10 days:Share volume exploded todayAnd in case you did not notice, the volume of shares traded today was enormous.  Total shares traded on the US exchanges was more than 18 billion shares.  That’s a lot of trading. For calibration, the day Lehman imploded way back in 2008 was around 19 billion shares traded. Here is an interesting chart for NYSE volume:https://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3047-nyse_volume.html. The NYSE traded 11.8 billion shares today. The previous RECORD was 11.1 billion shares. A normal day is like 4-6 billion shares.  Go figure.Own something real — like domain names!Elsewhere in today’s enormous trading day, gold has been rocketing higher — making all time highs in Euros, and approaching all-time highs in USD.  To be clear, I am not a gold-bug. However, I believe that investors are looking for something real that can be owned and traded as medium of exchange and as a basis for wealth preservation. Physical land is hard to take with you and there are plenty of risk factors that can change the value of physical land — just ask homeowners in Las Vegas, or beachfront property owners on the Gulf coast."
Seasonal Minisites – The e-File.com case study	6-May-10	"Seasonal websites are a tricky thing. They can be lucrative niches if executed well, e.g. Halloween sites, Mothers Day sites, Christmas sites, etc.  Seasonal websites usually correlate to what I call “Episodic purchases” –usually made by first-time customers who are looking for a quick solution to their issue.  E-File.com is one example of a seasonal Minsite that we operate.The History of e-File.comEd Stolarz brought us the domaine-File.com. We originally thought it should be auctioned or sold to someone in the tax preparation business. We still think that. We made a focused effort to sell the site to some of the logical end-buyers but could not get the 6 figure price tag that we thought was entirely warranted.  So, in February we quickly set up a Minisite with which to monetize the site for 2010 while also laying groundwork for building a more significant site.The site went live right around February 1.  It was authored inDevHub.com— a company with which Epik has close ties.  The DevHub solution offers integrated directory services which was helpful for quickly incorporating a directory of local tax advisors.Chathura, who leads our Sri Lanka based production center produced the site.  Sri Lanka is where we produce 10-30 Minisites per week, mostly for our own portfolio but increasingly for clients like Ed.How did it do?As expected, the traffic spiked around April 14 — the day before the tax day deadline. Here is the report from Google Analytics.The full Google Analytics file is available here for anyone who wants to study it:Analytics-EFILEThe revenue sources skewed towards LinkShare which was added shortly after the initial launch. You can see the relative split here for February-April period:Revenue from linkshare = $2,347.04Revenue from Adsense = $1,442.10Ed was pleased with the 2 month result as this was far better than what he was doing prior to the Minisite development.   It also provided real data with which to justify the 6-figure price tag that we think this site warrants to a strategic buyer.What’s next for e-File.com?A formal auction for the e-File.com domain is probably the right next step.  If there is a specialist for selling finance/tax sites, we are interested in having this name shopped to the right buyers.   OilPrices.com is another Epik-powered site that is a good candidate for a similar process.If we don’t sell the domain by summer time, e-File.com will be ready to go to the next level in time for the October 2010 filing deadline for extension filers. This will be a warmup for the 2011 tax reporting season.The two main improvements areas are:Improved ranking in search engines: The e-file.com site is competitively ranked in Bing and Yahoo but not Google.  The reason seems pretty clear, and that is the relatively lack of original and fresh content. For starters, that can be fixed with editorial work, article sourcing/syndication, and a relevant news feed.Integrated Directory Services:The directory feed we are using here is one from SuperPages. It does not monetize all that well, and there is no way for a service provider to pay to get listed.  Our forthcoming directory platform — TelephoneBook.com — will remedy this situation. Andthatis a subject of a future post!"
Retail Appraisals — A useful tool for selling domains to end-clients	5-May-10	"When trying to determine a fair price for a domain, end-clients usually look for some type of objective 3rd party assessment of what is fair market value for a domain name.   In the past we would send a client to Estibot. However, Estibot is really a tool for domainers.  Here is a useful tool that you can use for free when selling to end-clients.Appraise.Epik.Com is a free serviceFor developed websites with traffic, we have a scorecard that we have started to use that is designed to value the traffic.  This was the subject of arecent post. For undeveloped domains, the appraisal is not based on actual traffic but rather, it is based onpotentialtraffic.  This is like an oil field that has “unproven reserves”.  The same logic applies to domains.  There may be high search volumes, but if you can’t get ranked, it won’t bring you traffic.The Appraise.Epik.com tool is easy to use.  To use it, simply add your domain name to the end of the URL: https://appraise.epik.com/For example:https://appraise.epik.com/bridal-dresses.comHere is what you will find:The site takes a few seconds to load as it gathers the site data and attempts to make a screen capture.How is this tool different?The appraised values are generally higher than Estitbot — about 3X higher on average.  This is based on a proprietary valuation model that we are continuing to refine to better reflect fair market value based on end-client purchase patterns that we have observed from our own end-client sales.The scorecard also adds other supporting data where available in order to help a prospective buyer evaluate the attractiveness of the domain or website asset.  This scorecard will continue to improve.  For anyone familiar with a 409A valuation for private securities, there is a success model to follow.Looking AheadOur ultimate goal is to be able to support the efficient buying and selling of developed websites and developable domains. This is critically important for the growing number of retail investors.For sites that are hosted by Epik, we will also be able to show actual site statistics and will be able to use this data to inform the valuation of the domain or developed website.  This data integration is a work in progress but on that is progressing quickly and is the different between “unproven reserves” and “proven reserves”.In other words, a domain might be worth $5,000 on the basis of theoretical traffic. However, if it is actually making $300 a month from verified net revenue, it is possible to use an alternative valuation formula that reflects the projectable stream of cash flows."
Domain Farming: Three examples of creative domain development deals	4-May-10	"In my recent discussions with domainers from around the world, there are a few recurring patterns. One of the patterns is that many domainers are “long on domains and short on cash”.  This creates a challenge for domainers with large portfolios who cannot possibly fund development of all of their development-worthy domains. In times like this, it pays to think like a farmer.I was supposed to be a farmerMy maternal grandfather — Klaas Kornelius Meijer — was an important person to me growing up.  “Meijer” as they called him in the Northern Dutch town of Kommerzijl was a quality guy by any standard.  Meijer was a farmer. And as you can see below from the family photo archive, I was supposed to carry on the tradition.Although I did not end up taking over the family farm, I did learn a lot about farming, spending most summers as a kid working on my grandfather’s farm.  I even studied Agricultural Economics as I tried to reconcile the family expectation to become a farmer, and a personal bias towards entrepreneurship and business.So what does farming have to do with Domaining?Farming of cash crops is not all that different than raising young domains. If you think about it,Acquire, Develop, Operate, Sellis a near cousin of the farming equivalent ofPrepare, Plant, Fertilize and Harvest.  This is a gross oversimplification of farming but there is a method to growing things with scale, and that includes websites.  As with farming, it can be learned.  However, most domainers are stillmerchants— they can buy and sell, but most have little interest incultivating.Although I have no idea whether farmers are good candidates to become domainers, I do think there are a few traits that make them suitable to the role, particularly now that the technology is no longer the hardest part. Legend has it that one of the industry’s most successful domainers, Scott Day ofDigimedia, was a watermelon farmer before becoming a full-time domainer.  Scott assembled a great portfolio, and has methodically gone about adding value to his domains.As with farming, one can’t be an expert at growingeverything.  Yet, domainers will collect all manner of domains that have little to do with one another, and perhaps even less to do with one’s personal core competencies.  Right now, Epik is very good at developing Product Portals.   I believe we will soon be very good at developing video portals, directory portals and geo portals.  We are not good at adult, gambling or music.  We have aspirations to become good at travel portals and biography sites.RuilverkavelingThis is a fancy Dutch word for a practice that farmers did to exchange land with each other in order to assemble larger contiguous parcels of land.   This was needed particularly once farming became industrialized. Farmers needed less physical labor because they invested more heavily in equipment. However, in order for the equipment to make economic sense, they needed to work larger contiguous and symmetrical parcels of land.So farmers would swap land — sometimes with government “encouragement”.   Through this process, landowners got continuous parcels and became more efficient in their ability to work the land with large pieces of equipment that did not need to go onto the public roads in order to get from parcel to parcel.  Aside from the short-term gnashing of teeth by individual farmers, it usually worked out for everyone because productivity went up. And when it came time to sell their land, the farmers usually found that the assembled parcels were worth more.It worked for farmers — Domainers can do this tooOne of the big challenges the Domaining profession faces is that large number of non-contiguous domains are owned by domainers that don’t know each other. This creates a challenge for anyone trying to assemble related portfolios. For example, if Epik can assemble the top 50,000 product categories into an integrated portfolio, the whole portfolio becomes worth more. In the process of assembling the pieces, it is very possible that a portion of the web also ends up working better than it did before. That is an ambitious idea, but not a crazy one.Ultimately there will be further specialization within each major category.  For example, within the category of Product Portals, Epik has clients who are assembling different portfolios. Kenny Hartog is developing shoe and garment domains. Morgan Schwartz has been developing kitchen appliance and baseball equipment domains. Tony Lam has been developing furniture and medical equipment domains.  Avi Sacajiu has been developing jewelry domains. Etc.Time to think creativelyGetting the web to work better will require some creative deal-making among domainers who have different objectives. In our own small way, Epik is doing deals.  Here are a few illustrative examples from the last 24 hours of creative deals done with individual domainers who are making the jump to development.John Slaney:  John has way too many names to develop.   We came up with a creative deal that works for him and works for us.  He had a list of 4 names that he wanted to develop Pet-Tracking.com, Foldable-Bike.com, DetoxFootbath.net, and Candy-Bouquets.com. Rather than pay $249 per site to develop them, he offered up a portfolio of 12 names: bridesmaid-dress.com, babyfeedingproducts.net, birthstone-jewelry.com, arteasel.net, dog-jewelry.com, baby-bracelets.com, coppermailbox.net, graphictablets.net, tile-floors.com, gaswashers.com, office-lamps.com and glassdesks.net. All of these met our criteria for exact search volumes.  The net result of this cashless trade is that John will have gone from having 16 names that were costing him an annual reg-fee to maintain, to having 4 developed websites that will be income-producing and can then be sold as developed websites. Win-win.WeiWei Zeng and BeerCoolers.net:  WeiWei wanted to start developing on Epik. He also makes a living buying and selling domains.  WeiWei and I came with a deal that made sense for both of us.  WeiWei sold me a portfolio of 5 domains in exchange for $600plusthe right to develop one of his domains — BeerCoolers.net.  That development would have normally cost him $249. So, for $849 in cash and in-kind, Epik received these: motorbikejacket.net, golfballmarker.net, workoutball.net, dashboardmount.com, and travelshoulderbag.com. We’ll have WeiWei’s new site up in 3 weeks. Win-win.Craig Peterson and Chat-Rooms.com:  Craig already has a few developments being built on Epik. He is also one of the nicer guys I have met since launching Epik.  Last week, he surprised a few folks by buying the domain name Chat-Rooms.com.  That is a big domain that requires a pretty large development to execute on. I estimated a $20K development budget to build and launch a chat network across the Epik ecosystem. Since $20K was a pretty big nut, Craig offered up a domain of his that he did not plan to develop — UltrasoundMachine.com. Win-win.The net of all these 3 deals is that we now have the following domains available for others to develop:DomainAppraisedValueAd CompetitionAvgCpcSearchVolumeultrasoundmachine.com55,000low4.409,882motorbikejacket.net160high0.6949,410golfballmarker.net1,300high1.1818,056workoutball.net930high2.224,392dashboardmount.com7,400low2.082,318travelshoulderbag.com620high1.552,318bridesmaid-dress.com140high0.51110,410babyfeedingproducts.net1,500low1.8222,082birthstone-jewelry.com180high1.5518,056arteasel.net3,400high2.2214,762dog-jewelry.com140high1.2312,078baby-bracelets.com100high1.199,882coppermailbox.net3,700high3.669,882graphictablets.net1,800high2.619,882tile-floors.com660high2.098,052gaswashers.com1,800medium1.79475office-lamps.com120high2.605,368glassdesks.net890high2.6312,078Most of the acquisitions are product portal names that will either be developed by Epik, or by others.   UltrasoundMachine.com is a great domain but not in our immediate sweet spot.  The Estibot appraisal is a whopping $55K but it is worth less than that to me which is why I would happily swap it for a solid portfolio of Product Portal names that I know how to develop and monetize.Want to make a creative deal?

How to value a website with traffic	3-May-10	"Our friends over at Moniker are managing the auction for the WiFi.com website. WiFi.com has 30,000 monthly unique visitors for a keyword with a healthy CPC.  While there are a number of ways to value a website, the most obvious is to put a value on the traffic that it already gets.  This post shares how we did it, and also offers a free spreadsheet which you can use to do it too.The Valuation Model for WiFi.comThe tool we developed for valuing a website with traffic is pretty straight forward. It looks at monthly traffic from Google. The WiFi.com domain is #3 on Google for “WiFi” and #4 on Google for “Wi-Fi”. As it result, it gets a fairly steady stream of organic traffic for people looking for WiFi.  The average cost for a traffic buyer is believed to be about $1.41 for the “Wi-Fi” term.A 5-year discounted cash flow (DCF) model can be used to value in present dollars what the cost would be for that traffic stream for the next 5 years. We can then add to that, the “salvage value” of the residual asset, which continues to have value beyond the value of the traffic.  When you add those 2 primary sources of value, you get a reasonable present-day value for a site with traffic.  Here is a snapshot:My personal view is that WiFi.com is capable of tremendous traffic growth.  So, if we don’t sell the site at auction this month, we’ll complete development of a next-generation WiFi.com portal that is currently in development. The explosive growth of the Product Portal platform has caused us to put some developments on the back burner temporarily.  We remain highly enthusiastic about the category and look forward to staying involved with whoever acquires the site.Try the valuation model out yourselfThe model also has the ability to allow you to model out various growth scenarios.   You can download the valuation model for free here:Wifi.com Purchase ROI"

Why Greece matters to all of us	28-Apr-10	"It could not happen to a nicer country.   2500 years ago Greece was the center of Democratic humanity. Remember Solon’s reforms? Old glory. Today, the country Greece is for sale.  What’s next? Endorsement rights for the Parthenon? Pay attention since this actually matters to the domain name asset class.Why it matters?This is not going to impact only Greece. It is going to hit right at the heart of the European Monetary Union — which is a fiat currency backed by nothing, and governed by amonetarypolicy that has no binding influence on nationalfiscalpolicy.  As for Greek fiscal policy, a promise made was a promise broken.  The 3% EMU budget deficit maximum was never even achieved during the boom times, and is now completely toast in the bad times.  It was a whopping 13.9% of GDP in 2009.So, unfortunately for Prime Minister “G-Pap”, the Greek credit card has been shredded.  The IMF is orchestrating what is effectively “Debtor in Possession” financing for the country’s assets.   That would technically include historic treasures like The Parthenon and a bunch of nice islands in The Aegean Sea.The European Union, just recovering from the “EuroKill” volcanic ash-induced chaos, is scrambling to contain the collateral damage before it spreads to Spain, Portugal, Italy and Ireland. A re-financing of Greece spares other countries — notably France and Germany — from having to write down the principal on their Greek debt holdings.  Bankers call this practice “Extend and Pretend” or “Mark to Fantasy” (as opposed to “Mark to Market”).Meanwhile, the EMU policy coordination efforts go something like this:The EMU will be the first to go — and I actually believe itwillgo. This is one reason why we see the inexorable rise in the price of gold, particularly if you look at it denominated in Euros:Fiat currencies in general are at risk as central banks continually debase their currencies, effectively accepting asset reflation (some would say levitation!) as the price of wholesale currency debasement. The US is by no means out of the woods here but it is a beneficiary of “flight to quality” in large measure because major commodities are priced in dollars and there is no credible alternative reserve currency, at least for the moment.The stakes for the global economy are high and going higher.  US budget challenges notwithstanding, the US dollar will continue to benefit from being “backed” by the world’s most powerful armed forces, which provides some assurance of continued access to strategic natural resources, notably Middle East oil, which are to be paid for in … US Dollars.  Google “The Great Game” for more context on that topic.  Here is a politically incorrect primer on where Greece fits into the sequence of dominoes.Although the timing of the next major bout of economic volatility is not entirely known, certain financial markets are functioning as a “Prediction Market” (anyone want to develop Prediction-Markets.com?).  Two of the more notable prediction markets are VIX — an index of volatility — and Credit Default Swaps.  The VIX index was up 30% yesterday:And then BAM, Greek Credit Default Swap spiked higher again today (chart) while 2 year Greek Sovereign bonds are being placed with 20% interest rates. Ouch! Greek bonds are now officially Junk status, otherwise known as “not investment grade”.  The smart money knew this long before.There was agood paneltoday at the Milken Global Conference if you want more.The Bottom line: Expect the Unexpected.I stand by my theory that Domains are better than Dollars which I arguedhereandhere.  And even though your personal financial advisor might beg to differ on this advice, I would use any strength in the US dollar to consolidate a position in development-worthy domain names.At Epik we are also putting our money where our mouth is and are buying domains every day.  If you want to know what we buy (and sell), you can request to receive our Daily Acquisition Report by contacting me at rob -at- epik.com.In the meantime,expect the unexpected."

No auction crapshoot required!What are Epik clients looking for?The product portals that we are looking for have the following characteristics:The name should map to a product category or niche.  You can use Wishpot.com as a search engine to find products.The exact search volume needs to be 500+ for a name with $1+ CPC. We will consider lower for a $5+ CPC name.The name should not trespass on a registered trademark.A few other things:We prefer .com or .net.  For an exceptional keyword, we’ll consider another TLD.We will take hyphens that make sense.  So, Water-Bottle.com makes sense but Footbal-l.com does not.Are we buying?

What I learned about SEO	28-Apr-10	"Search Engine Optimization is a critical ingredient to launching a new site.  This post shares some of my experience with SEO — good and bad.  It also describes a special program for clients who want to experience the impact of professional SEO.I used to be a SEO skepticMy first serious exposure to SEO was through collaboration with Matias de Tezanos, the CEO ofHealthcare.com. I was a founding investor of the company and served as the Company’s first Chairman.  At one point Healthcare.com had more pages indexed than Wikipedia –more than 20 million pages.  Although that number came down over time,  the insight remained that there is a a right way and a wrong way to build an SEO footprint.  Today, Healthcare.com is #5 on Google for “Healthcare” — a highly competitive search term with more than 16 million monthly searches and more than 450,000 exact searches.My second major exposure to SEO was throughPatents.com, a company which I co-founded and still serve as Chairman. It competes with SEO heavyweight, FreePatentsOnline.com (FPO), a successful 2-man show that packages publicly available content in an SEO-friendly manner.  FPO company is fundamentally an SEO play, pretty much from start to finish. It is as impressive in its simplicity as it is remarkable in its financial success.  Today, Patents.com is #6 on Google for “Patents” executing a bigger, better version of the FPO model with global coverage and a more comprehensive approach to the Patent value chain.There are many more examples of sites that live or die by SEO as their primary source of new visitors.  And by this, I am talking about sites that get 90+% of their traffic from organic search — day in and day out — because they reliably answer a question that users of search engines are trying to answer. In 2007, I used to think SEO was largely a masturbatory exercise (I still think that about Twitter, by the way!). No longer. SEO matters.  You are helping Google to help the consumer to help you, and that is a win-win-win.SEO should be an integral part of Product LaunchThis Friday, Epik will release 102product portals, in addition to the normal cadence of Minisites.   In the next few weeks, we’ll also launchClothing.comand a completely redesignedDirectory Platform, both of which are large scale projects commensurate with the caliber of the domains they will power.  For the first time in the history of Epik, we have formally integrated SEO activities into the product launch cycle.  What does this mean?Best practices:One of the derivative benefits of partnering with demanding customers is that they share what they know. This in turn improves the entire platform.  While our SEO best practices are decent, Epik client, Avi Sacajiu ofClickResponse.net, brought in SEO talent Deborah Lipp as part of deploying a portfolio of product portals.  This uncovered some SEO improvements that are being deployed network-wide in the forthcoming upgrade.Search engine submission: There are many service providers who offer an automated solution to directory and search engine submission. The better providers also allow you to vary the submitted content in order to minimize redundancy.Article submission: Article submission has been acknowledged by SEO experts as on of the better performing SEO strategies. Article syndication services such as eZineArticles.com and AssociatedContent provide a vehicle for getting articles syndicated with integrated backlinks.Social Bookmarking:  These are typically done as manual submissions to popular bookmarking services in the form of endorsements of endorsement-worthy articles residing on your site.To be clear, this is not about “unnatural acts” that are designed to fool the search engines.  That is a fool’s game so I advise against trying it.  Rather this is about playing by the rules  — earning authority, trust and relevance — so that the algorithm can help the consumer to find a decent concentration of relevant content when searching.Does SEO work? The case study of IceCreamMaker.comPersonally, I am convinced that SEO, done well, is an excellent investment and a mandatory component of the site launch process.  It accelerates the entire process of turning an undeveloped domain into a thriving website. It also helps get you the type of recurring traffic that can be used to drive continuous improvement of the site — a topic for a future blog post.A case study that is taking shape right now on the product portals network is Kenny Hartog’sIceCreamMaker.com.  Last night, Kenny’s site moved from page 2 of Google’s SERP to #8 on Page 1. His traffic doubled overnight, including a tripling of Google traffic. Kenny’s net weekly revenue on IceCreamMaker.com alone was $60 last week and should crush that this week.Kenny is fast becoming one of the most active builders on the Epik network. His early deployments are cash flowing nicely and the newer builds are coming online rapidly.  I could not be happier for him.  He has built a solid portfolio of names with solid search patterns and is methodically optimizing each step of the value chain: Acquire, Develop, Operate, Sell.Epik’s SEO Partner NetworkEpik has negotiated bulk SEO services with selected SEO service providers.  We are looking for more and are benchmarking their performance over the short, medium and long-term.  As part of this vendor benchmarking process we have also negotiated better pricing, and we are passing these savings along to our clients who are building on Epik.  We can do this because SEO is not a profit center for Epik. It is an enabling investment that increases the value of sites that we build.

"Location, Location, Location – The Morgan Schwartz case study"	27-Apr-10	"One of the things I really enjoy about what we are doing at Epik is helping folks become effective domain developers.  One guy who is on the way to building a pretty sweet portfolio of income-producing properties is Morgan Schwartz.  He has figured out what I think the majority of domain owners have yet to really master — the art and science of separating the wheat from the chaff.Location, Location, LocationDomaining is really not all that different from real estate development.  In fact, I often find myself talking about a name being “one block off main street”, e.g. referring to a name that is good but not great, at least by the classic evaluation criteria. For example, a name that is hyphenated and/or not a .com.  To a developer, I have found thatgoodis oftengood enoughif you know what to look for to assess development potential.I see a lot of domain portfolios.  People send them for a variety of reasons — they want to sell them, they want help developing them, they are wondering whether to renew them, etc.   What I have learned from this exercise?  Two things in particular: (1) Domainers have acquired a tremendous amount of crap domains, and (2) Domainers spend far too much time obsessing about the NUMBER of their domans, rather than the QUALITY of their portfolio.There are of course many domains that we fall in love with for one reason or another — a brandable name, or a name to which we have some emotional attachment.  By all means keep renewing those names if you must. However, if you really want to be methodical about what I call “Keep or Toss”, you have to rely on the DATA. And by data I am referring mainly to (1) Exact search, (2) CPC, and (3) Ad competition.Why do I like these metrics?  Mainly because they are a good indicator of what private equity investors call “Addressable market”, or what a layman might describe as “How high is up?”. If you know these metrics, you can mathematically derive the theoretical value of being #1 on Google for that term.  It is an objective indicator and will keep you from renewing useless names that you are unlikely to ever developorsell.Morgan Schwartz — Friend of EpikMorgan Schwartz is one of Epik’s earliest clients.  He is also an active user of our Drop Catch service.  He is finding premium names on a near-daily basis by visiting our free site —Domains.Epik.comwhere we catalog the daily drop.  On each detail page, you can backorder the name.On Monday’s drop we acquired FaceWrinkleCream.net for him, which is now being developed into a product portal for a grand total of $249 — INCLUDING the name itself!  Estibot values the domain alone at $1,400 based on 15K+ searches, 1K+ exact searchs and $4+ CPC.  We appraise the nameeven higher.  Once the site is developed, indexed and ranked, I expect the value will go even higher.  I say, good one on Morgan.Here is the rest of Morgan’s haul from the past week using Epik’s “Catch and Develop” service:DomainAppraisedValueAdCompetitionAvgCpcAvg SearchVolumeicecreamcones.net570high0.5510,044ethernetrouters.com5300high3.321,091pressure-cookers.com2700high3.5418,352drumsander.net1600high2.198,184rubbersandals.com2100medium0.84892camcordermicrophones.com4600high1.651,98What are you waiting for?Come catch with us."
Pagerank domains – what you need to know	26-Apr-10	"One of the derivative benefits of domain development is building Pagerank.  A number of the early developments have now achieved page rank — in some cases significant.  We can’t possibly develop all of them so from time to time we’ll make names available for sale or co-development.What is Pagerank?For the uninitiated, Pagerank is part of Google’s algorithm for determining which sites have authority, i.e. are trusted as having content worthy of being indexed and viewed. Although the algorithm is a black box, the Pagerank indicator is exposed for public view. This is presumably to help webmasters gauge whether they are on the right track, as well as a way to help webmasters avoid linking to or from “bad neighborhoods”, i.e. sites that have zero or no pagerank.The origins and meaning of Pagerank are exhaustively discussed elsewhere.  What matters is that there is still a consensus among SEO experts that it matters a lot, and that it is a good metric to track not just on the homepage, but also on individual pages and subdomains.A short Epik case studyConsider this comparison for Epik.com and the core subdomains:Epik.com– PR4: This is the flagship site.  It was an unranked site a year ago when Epik got started.  This site is almost entirely original content.  Incidentally, the Pagerank got its big jump when we launched the Epik blog.  One clue that Google assigns relative importance to the blog area is that theEpik blog pagehas PR2, whereas the olderEpik product menuis unranked.Auctions.Epik.com– PR2:  This site was created when Epik acquired DNKO.com and relaunched the site.  Users are submitting newly listed domains, and in so doing are often adding original content to their listings. Traffic is ramping nicely here.Domains.Epik.com– Not ranked: This site is an index of dropping domains. While we believe it has a meaningful amount of original content, evidently Google disagree.  You be the judge — we think this is a pretty worthy site.  The site has tremendously high page views per visit.Directory.Epik.com– Not ranked:  In this case, Google probably got it right. Our vision here was to create a large directory of sites where we mapped content to domains using a mechanized approach. There is no significant user-generated content here yet, which is why I will concur with the algorithm. For now.As you can see, each subdomain — and in fact each page — has its own Pagerank.  The vast majority of pages are still unranked. This is not unique to Epik but is a fairly typical pattern that I believe many developers will see in their own sites and networks.The consensus in the SEO community is that the Google algorithm is getting  smarter.  As a result, there are no sustainable shortcuts.  Trust will have to be built the old fashioned way.  The various SEO consultants out there, who are whoring out Pagerank domains will likely hear the bell tool soon.If you are going buy a Pagerank domain, I think your best bet is to use it for legitimate purposes. You can still backlink to other sites that are correlated to the theme of the Pagerank site.  This is a sustainable SEO strategy that builds real value.Epik Pagerank domains available for sale or co-developmentAfter a year of network development, there are signs that these efforts are bearing some SEO fruit. Here is the list with Estibot stats below.  A few comments:Estibot’s Pagerank checker is not bulletproof so I hand-verified the PR3 and above names and highlighted them in bold below.Estibot’s appraisal appears not to value Pagerank. I don’t know why but it is a major flaw. In other words, no, we won’t be selling a PR4 domain with $4.94 CPC for $10.Several of the sites have already been built into product portals, and have since gotten ranked.

Why I like hyphenated domains	17-Apr-10	"Domainers who still avoid names with hyphens are stuck in what I call the “parking industry time warp”.  Search engines actuallylikehyphens.  Nevertheless, every day, great hyphen names are dropping.  Epik is picking them up by the dozens.  This post summarizes a few recent hyphen catches and why I like them.Hyphens work — and I can prove itEpik only recently became active in the drop-catch business.  One of the things we wanted to confirm early on was whether hyphenated names would receive equal ranking as non-hyphenated names in terms of their SEO potential. While the sample size is not large, the early indication is that hyphenated names perform just fine.  For the time being, these hyphenated names can be acquired and developed more cost effectively.  Here are a few recent builds that are performing well:Ergonomic-Keyboards.comKnife-Block.comStereo-amplifiers.comToddler-boots.comSpandex-shorts.comBaby-dresses.comTennis-bag.comChandelier-earrings.comMary-janes.comBloodpressure-monitor.comComputer-batteries.comWrap-dresses.comFragrant-candles.comDog-feeders.comEthernet-cable.comPet-collars.comCar-adapter.comdvd-copier.comHandheld-vacuum.comWireless-printers.comWine-accessories.comAnswering-machines.comAquarium-equipment.comChristmas-light.comNow, keep in mind that every one of these names was a recent drop-catch and that these sites have been live for between 30 and 90 days.  You can track how any of these sites are doing by adding /stats at the end of the URL.  The bottom line is that there is nothing wrong with these domains.  They are development worthy!And what about 2 hyphens?The next obvious question is whether the above logic also applies to names with 2 hyphens.  Estibot significantly punishes these names in terms of valuation.  However, once again, I think Estibot has it wrong. Here are a couple of early examples:The-Party-Store.com: 232 pages indexed.  $264 gross revenues in month 2.Compact-digital-cameras.com:  203 pages indexed.  $613 gross revenues in month 2Our experience with 2 hyphens is much more limited.  We don’t love them but if there is enough search volume for a term that deserves to be 3 words long, we’ll take them.  We have not exactly backed up the truck, but we are buying them.And what about DOUBLE–hyphensDouble–hyphen names drop routinely. Many of them are not worth reg-fee even if they hadonehyphen, not two.  The question we wanted to answer was whether a “”–” was the kiss of death in terms of indexing potential, or whether it made for a diamond in the rough. Our theory is that it is the latter.Tony Lam is an Epik client who gets it.  Yesterday, Tony and I agreed to developgolf–clubs.comandwedding–dress.comwhich Epik had recently picked up.  Also, this week, we picked upstock–trading.com,security–system.comandespresso–machine.comAlthough Tony is  a dentist by profession, he has become a talented domainer in his spare time.  If my theory is correct, those 2 names that we sold him for $249 — including a product portal — should do great for him.   We’ll know in a few months.And what about domains with h-y-p-h-e-n-sI have never been a  fan of such names.From a previous trial we learned that h-y-p-h-e-n names are not strong index candidates.   However, this particular trial was run for about 90 days and without the benefit of original content.  As such, I deem this prior trial as inconclusive.Earlier today we picked up the domain namea-d-u-l-t.comon the drop  The Estibot appraisal of this name iszeroeven though the term has tremendous search volumes.Tony Lam is stepping up to develop this one as well.So why do Pro domainers drop these great namesSeasoned pros like Frank Schilling are routinely dropping hyphen names and .net names. Oftentimes they are holding on to the corresponding .com names.  My understanding is that they are hoping that some end-clients will acquire the name, invest hugely in them, and then come begging  for the non-hyphenated name that the Pro domainers have safely tucked away, all while accruing some modicum of type-in traffic.  The same logic applies to high quality .net names that routinely drop.As the old saying goes: one man’s trash is another man’s treasure.  Epik acquires these names every day, and are completely delighted that the corresponding premium .com domains sit idle as parked sites.  As far as the search engines are concerned, the developed domain getsranked, while the parked domain getsspanked!  Anyway, we’ll keep picking them up.  If you want a few bucks for them, drop me a note before you drop them."
The shell game	8-Apr-10	"It has been a little busy over here at Epik HQ. As a result, there has not been as much time to comment on the global economy.  For anyone needing a quick update on what is going on with fiat currencies, and the US dollar in particular, here is an informative post on a great site.The site is a personal favorite, calledZeroHedge, which is slightly irreverent but provides a perspective on the financial markets that is not available from mainstream media. Their coverage of Greek economy and the collateral risk to the European Monetary Union is unmatched.The author of the article, entitled “The Greatest Shell Game Ever”, is Chris Martenson, who runs a site of his own at ChrisMartenson.com.  Here is thelink to the article. His crash course is a video primer on the present state of the economy and how we got here. It is slightly depressing for anyone who is not naturally optimistic. You can check out the crash coursehere.Another entertaining pundit on global finance is Max Keiser, who operates MaxKeiser.com. Here is a typical video post from earlier today:I believe the more you research, the more you will agree that Domains are better than Dollars which I have explainedhereandhere."

The domain is 100% owned by the client and there is no minimum time to stay on Epik. So, for $249, you get a domain name AND a hand-crafted website.  After 1 year, if the developed site has not grossed at least $250 in revenue, we’ll buy the site back for $249.  It is a no-brainer.The Daily CatchA number of folks have asked if we would share our daily catch list.

Ergonomic-Keyboards.com – month 2 gross revenues	7-Apr-10	"Product portals continue to be a hot topic.  Yesterday, I went out on a limbendorsing hyphenated names and .net names, saying that they are undervalued, and can be attractive drop-catch targets for development.  Today, I thought I would share a simple case study of a hyphenated name:Ergonomic-Keyboards.com.About Ergonomic-Keyboards.comI acquired Ergonomic-Keyboards.com last October on the drop.  It was apparent that one of the domain’s prior owners did develop it, which you can see by visitingArchive.org. While it is not possible to see the actual website, it is clear that there was something there in 2004 and 2005.When I acquired the name on the drop, I was surprised at the  mismatch between the appraised value and the search statistics for this domain. Estibot values this domain at just$100.  While I am huge fans of Esa and Luc at Estibot, I believe they have this one wrong.  Why?1. It is a good example of a winnable niche category with healthy monthly search volumes — 9800 exact monthly searches even for the plural.2. The average CPC at $2.42 suggests that there are high margins in this category, sufficient for advertisers to pay top dollar for traffic.3. The non-hyphenated name (ergonomickeyboards.com) is already developed. The owner of which has since indicated an interest in buying the name.Here is what the site looks like:How is it doing?March was the second full month for the site to be live. It grossed $784 and netted $46.91. You can check out the statshere. In February, it grossed $376 and netted $19.31.   So, month over month, the gross is up 100%, and the net is up 143%. In terms of site indexing, the site has 208 pages indexed in Google though it is not yet competitive ranked.  It is #4 on Yahoo.  It is off to a good start and has good prospects.  Want to buy this site? Visit the auction listinghere— the auction closes in 24 hours.Product portal networkProduct Portals are a growth priority for Epik. Product portals figure also prominently into Epik’s largerecosystem plansfor an integrated media and commerce network. As of the end of March, we have 572 sites live in the product portal network. We are adding 50-60 per week and are increasing production capacity. These are hand-crafted sites that leverage a unified platform that continues to be improved at a rapid pace.Individual product portals will take time to mature but the fundamental logic for them is obvious: in a world of abundant choices and streamlined supply chains, we will see hyper-fragmentation of online retail, the discovery of which is enhanced by search engines. This is nothing more than taking the success formula ofCSN StoresandHayneedle, to the logical extreme of a network of “long tail” online boutiques.For more information, about product portals, see myprior post on this topic, visit theproduct overview page, or contact me at rob -at- epik.com."
Catch domains for reg-fee … or even free!	6-Apr-10	"Do you ever get tired of paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars to a drop-catching service who you know paid reg-fee? I know I did. That’s why I spent the last year working on an approach to (1) screen for names, (2) drop-catch them for reg-fee, (3) turn them into income producing websites that can be (4) sold to an end-client. I call this process Acquire – Develop – Monetize – Sell. It works. Want in? Read on.I have been interested in drop-catching since 2007The drop-catch business is fascinating to me. Every day some 80,000 names are dropped. Domains worth 3, 4, 5 and even 6 figures are dropped by their prior owners.  A drop-catcher picks these names up at reg-fee and then arbitrages the spread between reg-free and fair market value.  There are domainers who are making a very good living doing exactly this, working just a few hours a day. One of my goals with Epik is to equip more people to do this better, and in the process of doing so, serve as a catalyst to get more domain names into the hands of the people who can add value to them, regardless of whether these domains are powered by one of Epik’s domain development solutions.So you think you can  … catch?Our catch rate is on the order of 70-80%. The losses are mainly to the familiar titans, notably Snapnames and NameJet.  Here is what I caught yesterday — all for reg-fee:hoodedrobes.combiometricusb.comdeerknives.comirishornament.complungerholder.compicassoprint.commooseantler.comkitchen-cooktops.comfloortransitions.commeshtray.comhelmetstrap.cominfant-costume.commacramebracelet.comcertifiedscuba.comlegal-funding.comhelpwithbills.neticecubetrays.neticefishingrod.netThis is a typical catch day. Many of these will get developed on ourproduct portal platform, which I blogged abouthere. Other domains will get sold to end-clients.  In a few days, I will blog about our proprietary solution for selling domains to end-users. This will be another step towards achieving a long-term goal for Epik, namely of becoming “The Domainers best friend”.Introducing Domains.Epik.com — and how you can catch for freeIf you have read this far, you are in for a treat.  I am going to share with you the main tool that I use to find domains to drop-catch. The tool will continue to improve but it is already a good solution for anyone who wants to find good drop-catch domains.1. Visitdomains.epik.com. This is the tool that we developed to help with drop-catch screening. It is still a work in progress but it works pretty well for finding attractive catch targets.  It covers a number of popular TLDs. If you visit the site, here is what you will find:2. By clicking “Details” next to any name, you can see statistics on the domain. This information can be helpful in determining whether a name is a good drop-catch candidate. Personally, I tend to look for names with 1000+ monthly searches, $1+ CPC, and no discernible trademark issues.3. Prior to catching a name, I usually go to Google, or to our product portal partner,Wishpot, in order to determine whether the domain is a good candidate for turning into an onlinebusiness. If this can be done using one of existingdomain development platform solutions, even better.You can  place orders directly through our integrated shopping cart at the bottom of each domain’s detail page. Please note that we are currently catching only for com and net. This is not to imply that I think other TLDs are not valuable but rather is mainly a limitation of the registry connections.If you already know that you want to develop the domain into an Epik-powered site, we’ll be happy to catch the domain forfree.  Just send the domain target list to rob – at – epik.com at least a few hours before the drop, and preferably the night before.Tips for using Domains.Epik.comAlthough this tool has been a work in progress, I have found it to be very helpful for finding great names to acquire and develop. A few closing comments on how to make the best use of this tool.The best way I have found to search for development candidates is to sort either by search volume or appraisal.  You can also do some basic filtering using the “refine search” feature.   We’ll improve these search tools over time.When selecting domains for development, keep in mind that search engines don’t discriminate against hyphens and they appear to also like .net about as much as .com.  Hyphens are a natural delimiter for concatenated words. This leads to many great development candidates getting dropped.If you want a fast way to look up the stats on a domain name, you can do so by entering https://domains.epik.com/yourdomain.com.Financial Independence through Domaining?When I became a full-time domainer in March 2009, many people in both my professional and social circle wondered what in the heck I was thinking. Since I had already built one successful startup, my family was kind enough to suspend disbelief. Meanwhile, in January, Epik added its first round of outside capital, raising $800,000 at a valuation of $12 million. Although this is a small financing by venture standards, it lets us accelerate some development projects that I look forward to blogging about in the months ahead.From my discussions with clients, I know that many domainers are wanting to become financially independent through a combination of (1) income from operating sites, and (2) upside from periodic sale of sites. I think financial independence is absolutely an achievable goal. Some of these domainers are putting together portfolios of domains bought from domain auction sites, often paying 3, 4 and 5 figures for each domain. That adds up!  The closer you get to reg-fee, the more chances you have of havingoneof your seed domains being able to return enough capital to pay forallof the domains you are still holding.In summary, I believe drop-catching should be part of every domainer’s gameplan for growing an income-producing portfolio.  Drop-catching works particularly well during tough economic times; while a recovery may be under way, it remains an uneven economic recovery, with high unemployment, and significant financial pressure on individual households. This is one of several reasons why good domains get dropped, and all the more reason to be reviewing the drop lists on a regular basis to find high potential drop-catch candidates."

It is the first slideshow web publishing platform that supports most of the major Powerpoint animation features in a web browser.  To use it, simply upload a Powerpoint file, and a few moments later your slideshow can be displayed in a secure read-only web format — complete with effects, builds, sound and video.  By contrast, Slideshare.net and Scribd allow only a static slideshow experience.What is also notable about Slideshow.com is that it is our first site built entirely on a Microsoft stack — .NET, SQL Server, Silverlight and Azure cloud services.  The thinking here is that Microsoft will eventually need a strategy to migrate the Powerpoint brand to the web while at the same time reinforcing the Microsoft search strategy. We hope they might choose Slideshow.com.We are looking forward to a steady pace of improvements to Slideshow.com. Over time, we expect Slideshow.com media objects to appear across the Epik network and hopefully beyond.  In addition, we are really excited about the Silverlight platform and what it offers in terms of an advanced platform for rendering multimedia in novel ways.The idea of Questions.com is simple — create a natural language search engine which helps a user to find places on the web where they can get answers to their specific question. However, rather than cluster all answers to all questions in one megasite, Questions.com applies a federated model where the content is distributed across a network of subject-specific sites that combine content and community.The deployment of Questions.com has just begun and will continue during the current beta phase.  If all goes as planned, within the next 90 days, we expect to roll out Questions.com across more than 1 million sites. We also plan to open up a Questions.com API to other publishers who wish to embed Q&A into their approved websites.The Epik EcosystemFrom the outset, our objective at Epik has been to build what we refer to as a User-centric semantic media network. That’s a complicated way of describing a user experience that is consistent from site to site and where content is intuitively cross-linked across sites.  The following image is illustrative of the emerging Epik network, including both (1)verticalcontent like Directory portals, Product Portals, Q&A portals and Reference portals, and (2)horizontalcontent such asIdentity.net,Questions.com,Comments.comandAppointment.com, to name a few.Update on Product PortalsEpik’s network of product portals continues to grow at a steady pace.  Recent feature additions include coupons, metrics reporting, improved SEO, and integrated Q&A.  During the next few months, expect a series of new innovations, including universal shopping cart with payment clearing, product submission, Twitter broadcasting, price break alerts and integrated A/B testing.We are enthusiastic about what is taking shape here. For example, think of a universal shopping cart like being able to go to a mall and shop at any of the boutiques and specialty stores and then only have to go to one register to pay for your purchases after shopping anywhere in the mall. That vision is not too far off into the future.  There is more to come from theEpik | Product platform.  A sampling of portals appear below.Hard DrivesBikinisFlapper DressFlight Attendant CostumesHalloween Costumes for BabyRose PendantSterling Silver Heart LocketTennis RacketsAudio booksBluetooth SpeakersBluetooth headsetCompact speakersComputer batteriesComputer lapdeskEReadersInternet Security SoftwareiPod StereoLanguage Translation SoftwareNetwork SwitchesPC NotebooksWireless PrintersAikido BokkenAquarium EquipmentBag CoutureBlack Pleated SkirtBlack Riding BootsCamping and OutdoorsCheap SkisChildren ClothesCinch BagsCup and SaucerDiaper ZoneDining Room TableFlat Ankle BootsIroning AccessoriesKnickersOrganic Soy CandlesRed Pleated SkirtRice Cookers and SteamersSnow MobileStand MixerTennis BagWine AccessoriesCar ElectronicsGun and TackleRechargeable ToothbrushStenciling SuppliesAnswering MachinesBody CalipersCalculatorChondroitin SulfateColor LaptopCompact Digital CamerasCrunchesDVD CopierElectronic Chess SetEmergency FoodErgonomic KeyboardsEthernet SwitchesFlat Screen MonitorHandcraftedKaraoke MachineModel ShipMusical InstrumentNight TherapyOffice ProductsOffice StationeryOnline Tax SoftwarePop up BooksPortable HeadphonesPrinter TonersStereo AmplifiersThe Party StoreToy Storage BoxTrumpet StandVegas Slot MachineWidescreen MonitorBaseball Batting HelmetBaseball MasksBike TrainersBraCuticle TrimmersElectric GraterFoil ShaversInduction CookersMini GymsMoustache TrimmersNewborn StrollerNose TrimmersRechargeable LightingScuba Diving WatchtesScuba MaskShake FlashlightsWhiteboardsBaby SocksBaby BassinettesBabysitter MonitorBeauty MaskBed comfortersBoot cut LeggingsBroiling PanCake Decorating SuppliesChampagne StoppersChandelier EarringsChewable Fish OilChristmas LightCoal StovesCustom Baby PillowDiamond Hoop EarringFac shavingFashion WalletsFleece JacketsFormal ShawlsFragrant CandlesGold ChokersHerbal FacialHumidity ControlIce Cream MakerLaceup BootLacy BraLog Splitting EquipmentMakeup CasesMary JanesMetric Socket SetsNail EnhancementsNewboard HatsOutdoor Deep FryerPamphletRingsSpandex ShortsToddler BootsUnique ScrubsWaterproof ConcealerWrap around DressWrap CardiganWrinkle Free Dress ShirtAnimal PinatasBachelorette PartiesBlood pressure MonitorDesigner Key RingsHairdryer DiffuserHandheld VacuumHome CopierImmune BoostsKnife BlockLCD Flat Panel MonitorLed Zeppelin AlbumsMagnesium MalatePersonal ScootersWrap DressesAloe Vera GelAnti Aging ComplexCar AdapterColored Hair ExtensionsDigital Voice RecordersiPod Wall ChargerPCI Wireless AdapterTooth WhiteningsUSB Keyboard AdapterUV CreamUV MoisturizerUSB Memory StickPercussion"
Why domains are better than dollars – Part II	9-Feb-10	"The financial wizards are hard at work so far in 2010. On the heels of theannual Davos summit, central bankers and finance ministers from around the world have been on world tour — fromSydneytothe Arctic. There would appear to be a lot of fingers in the dam right now as national economies try to wean themselves from government stimulus. Herewith are a couple of major developments to watch in the coming weeks along with the implications for domainers.Precious MetalsPrecious metals, notably gold, is what some economists callArmageddon Insurance. Mathematically, for gold to function as a global currency, it would need to trade in the range of $3,000 to $5,000 per ounce — well above the current level of $1,077 which is already more than the intrinsic value. In other words, the trading price is partly about intrinsic value, but mostly it is a bet on the viability of traditional national currency systems as an enduring store of value.What is interesting about precious metals as a store of value is that most of it is held in the form of paper rather than physical metal. The typical paper forms are (1) Exchange traded funds like GLD, (2) long or short commodity contracts, and (3) shares in mining or resource companies. In recent days there has been chatter about the breakdown of the physical market for bullion.  Here is one relevant analysis about theBreakdown in the Gold Market.Although not being covered in the mainstream press, many mints and dealers are reportedly out of stock and backordered of physical precious metals.  In other words, supply is greater than demand when it comes to the physical good.  Unlike fiat currencies, or paper contracts, one can’t conjure up more physical supply of a rare metal. New supply has to be discovered, mined and processed. This is a development worth watching.Greece — why it mattersIn other news, pay close attention to recent movements in Greek’s Sovereign debt.  This is more significant thanIceland’s national bankruptcy.  It is a test case for the future of the Euro as a currency union. It is part of the larger PIGS story, which stands for Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain, all of which are pushing the boundaries of EMU membership compliance.  The below picture tells the story of a nation whose credit card is in the process of being shredded:For the moment, there is more rumor than news.  If Greece is bailed out, as is now being rumored, the whole thesis of EMU fiscal guidelines (e.g. 3% maximum deficit as % of GDP) is completely out the window; member nations will have been granted an implied license for moral hazard.  STRATFOR did agood analysis of why Greece matters, and notably why Germany is stuck between a rock and a hard place.Domain names as asset classThe implication here is that as the global economy struggles to resume a sustainable and endogenous growth track, the fundamental risks are still largely unchanged.  At the same time, the list of attractive alternatives to the US Dollar is shrinking — this at a time when the US Dollar is not all that attractive! The silver lining for Domainers is that the online economy is healthy, capital efficient andincreasingly profitable.Premium domains have many of the characteristics of being a desirable alternative asset class.  Over the last several weeks, I have had a series of discussions with asset management groups and hedge fund managers about the “Domain names as asset class” thesis. The light bulbs are going on and for a growing percentage of these fund managers, there is serious consideration of domain names as a store of value in uncertain times.Why does this make sense? Simple. Domain names can be priced in any currency, operated from anywhere, and owned by anyone. In other words, domain names are a portable store of value that can be transferred instantly across the globe from one owner to another. They can even be owned anonymously. This message of “Domains as an asset class” is an important one to reinforce as it is key to moving beyondintrinsicvalue and unlockingspeculativevalue.For more on the topic of domain names as asset class, see my prior post on why “Domains are better than dollars“."
Patents.com and UTEK (UTK) form strategic partnership	14-Jan-10	"I am pleased to announce that after months of planning, Epik portfolio company,Patents.com, has formed a strategic partnership with publicly-tradedUTEK Corporation, a leader in intellectual property licensing.  Details of the deal can be foundherewhich includes both an operating partnership and a 6 month Right of First Refusal (ROFR) to acquire Patents.com.The history of Patents.com is an interesting one. The domain was originally secured byInternet Real Estate Groupin a $1.1 million cash purchased that was financed byDomain Capitalin 2007. In late 2007, I approached Internet Real Estate Group about developing the domain into a global search engine for patents that would be monetized through peer-to-peer intellectual property licensing transactions.When pursuing a domain development, I tend to go through an analysis exercise that chooses between (1) build, (2) partner, or (3) acquire — or sometimes a hybrid of one or more strategies. In the case of Patents.com, we acquired PatentMonkey and then partnered with translation technology partner, Worldlingo, to jump-start what is today Patents.com.During 2008-2009, the company made solid progress in executing an ambitious strategy for building a global patent search engine. Our larger vision for the business called for adding community features, and integrating an intellectual property exchange. In December 2009, Patents.com released its biggest upgrade to date, including extensive community features and improved site usability.The UTEK deal builds on this operating momentum from the December upgrade. One of the most exciting aspects of the UTEK partnership is the realization of our long-time vision for Patents.com to also enable licensing transactions.  As a result of the UTEK partnership, when you search for a keyword, you will be able to see which patents are available for license, and then click through to begin a licensing transaction. Ka-ching.Patents.comis an excellent example of domain development done right.  To build a company of the complexity of Patents.com is a challenge in any economic climate. However, to do this during 2008-09 is nothing short of heroic.  Congratulations toPaul Ratcliffe, CEO and Co-Founder of Patents.com. I could not be more pleased with what I see taking shape with Patents.com in 2010."
Does your domain name have a mobile strategy?	17-Dec-09	"One of the most significant developments taking shape in 2010 is the all out footrace to power the mobile internet.  iPhone, Google Android, and Amazon Kindle are three of the more visionary platform entrants.   The pace of innovation in the area of mobile internet is breathtaking. Forward-thinking domainers can profit from this megatrend.A growing trend in the US is to “cut the cord”, i.e. to use the mobile phone as the primary phone.  The corollary to cutting the phone cord is to use a mobile device as a primary internet access device.  Outside of the US, there are many economies that completely skipped fixed line internet and have greater than 50% mobile internet penetration. As more personal data moves into the cloud, and as costs for mobile data fall, look for this trend to accelerate.For domain developers, I believe there are two primary considerations:1.The rear-view mirror is not a good indicator: At current traffic sources and browser sources, it would be easy to conclude that mobile traffic is too low to be a priority.  The average % of sites across the Epik network that is being accessed by mobile browsers is under 5%.  The reflex conclusion here would be to not develop with the mobile user in mind.  I believe that this conclusion is short-sighted. Therewillbe a #1 on the mobile web for a range of tasks traditionally conducted on the desktop:finding a restaurant,find a Wi-Fit hotspot,finding a beauty salon,asking a question,finding a place to park,searching for patents,file a consumer complaint,scheduling an appointmentand eventually,shopping for products. After all, worldwide, the majority of the web users arealreadymobile web users. As such, to ignore the mobile web user is short-sighted. Moreover, the user experience will improve very quickly.2.Advertising is not the primary source of revenue for mobile apps — and likely won’t be.  All indications are that 2010 will be the year of the mobile app.  Not only will we have a vast number of iPhone apps, but now Android apps, Nokia Apps, and perhaps even Kindle Apps (rumored), etc.  Many of these apps can and will combine (1) an up front fee to install the app, and (2) recurring fees for using it. Domains have a role to play here.  For openers, there is affiliate-based income for promoting apps.  However, I believe far more interesting is to partner with an app developer who may need a better domain name for promoting their clever new app on one or more mobile platforms.  For example, earlier this week we picked up the domain namePersonality-Quiz.com(on the drop). We are now working to find an iPhone app developer with experience in the area of do-it-yourself personality assessment.Finally, for anyone looking for a good primer on what is going on mobile, check out this monstrosity of a slide deck, authored by Morgan Stanley.  Thanks to Steve Epstein, CEO ofIDN Options, for bringing it to my attention.The Mobile Internet Report – Key Themes"
Why the Internet is the future of independent media	13-Dec-09	"We are living inradically transformative times. Though mass media would not make it obvious, the pace of change is actually accelerating with the likely outcome that 2010 will be the most transformative year that the world has ever seen.  While I will steer clear of making a list of 2010 predictions in a single post, I will go ahead and predict that 2010 will be the year that micropublishing crosses the chasm. Why?Mass media is now largely controlled — directly or indirectly — by oligarchs:  If you study the ownership structure, and influence structure of mass media, it becomes clearer that there is reason why the public is being deluged with useless tripe about Tiger Woods’ obsession with white women. The US mass media is completely under reporting far more significant developments that are going on concurrently: (1) Imminent passage of the largest expansion of government since FDR under the banner of healthcare reform, (2) negotiations in Copenhagen that introduce global governance funded by a series of taxes on carbon production and economic output, and (3) Negotiations for the 2010 stimulus bill that Obama can be expected to announce at his State of the Union Address. The scale of horse trading that is in progress is likely unparalleled butthe media is not reporting on it,at least not until it is a done deal.The economics of self publishing is getting more attractive:  Last week, I had the opportunity to speak with independent publisherEllen Brown.  She self-published the book calledWeb of Debtwhich I recommend for your holiday reading list.  I downloaded the ebook and am now reading it on my new Kindle — available on Epik’sproduct portal calledeReaders.net.  What is notable about Ellen’s book is that by self-publishing, she keeps 40% of cover price, and for eBooks, she keeps ~100% of the selling price.  A typical publisher would give the content creator 3-7% in royalty and would also take months to go from manuscript to published work.  In this fast-changing world, that is a structural advantage for the eBook publishing format.  Also, Amazon is executing brilliantly with the launch of the Kindle and continued improvement of the product and platform. The eBook is a game-changer.The stage is set for online self publishing to go mainstream — beyond free blog posts and podcasts to eBooks and on-demand video. Big name pundits are starting to get it. Here are a few recent examples that independent media is alive and well.Prolific author and pundit, Thomas Friedman, had agood Op-Ed piece in today’s New York Times. The article speaks to the transformative impact of two converging forces: The Great Recession and what he refers to as “The Great Inflection”. The latter is really about the web.  Here is the relevant synopsis:The Great Inflection is the mass diffusion of low-cost, high-powered innovation technologies — from hand-held computers to Web sites that offer any imaginable service — plus cheap connectivity. They are transforming how business is done.TechCrunch had a relevant post today about theimpact of micro publishing. They spin it negatively but I think the author misses the point. The more relevant article is the one that theyreference in Wired.comwhich describes the very real scenario of large numbers of journalistsquitting their day jobs and publishing independently.So, for the moment, independent publishing and the free press is alive and well. However, make no mistake, the free press is under siege and 2010 is likely to be a pivotal year for the preservation of independent media. Independent media is at the core of “the wisdom of the crowds”.   History shows that the crowd ultimately gets it right if they have the right information.  However, the crowd’s capacity to get it right is a function of having access to competing views and open dissemination of fact and perspective.  This is what is at risk as the media consolidates further at a time when much of the internet still operates in no-man’s land.Implications for domainersI believe there are three notable implications for domainers.  The first one is tactical and immediate. The second and third ones are strategic and looming.Creators of content should be prepared to take control of their online presence. Epik owns many  domains that correlate to the names of individualjournalists,authorsandeconomists, among others. Epik owns the domain name PaulKrugman.com. We picked it up on the drop. This domain is intended for one man and one man only, and that is the author and punditPaul Krugmanwho blogs for the New York Times.  Their publishers may seek to compel the release of these names. However, Epik’s policy is very simple.  We only release a domain name to the individual that we believe logically should own the domain, and only if we receive the request personally from the individual — not their publisher, not their agent, and not their attorney.  Alternatively, Epik can provide these content creators with a versatile publishing platform that integrates content monetization.Domainers need to be prepared to defend their rights. During 2010, I predict a global showdown that will likely envelop ICANN.  Independent publishing on the internet is predicated on access to domain names (or subdomains). What if this right could be taken away?  It could happen and while the United States offers its citizens First Amendment rights, if ICANN became a pillar of global governance, these rights protected by the US Constitution will go away. In other words, global governance, and the control over the issuance and tolling of domain names is a hugely important issue and transcends US norms. If global governance can create and sell carbon credits at market prices while controlling the supply of these credits, why would domain names be immune to similar dictat?Domainers should anticipate more radical change around content delivery: On December 4,Comcast announced that it is buying NBC Universalin a deal valued at $30 billion.  This further consolidates global media delivery as didNews Corp’s acquisition of Dow Jones, including the Wall Street Journal, as well as many other media assets. YouTube is a remarkable exception. The volume of independent publishing is incredible and the virality with which good content spreads is amazing.  So far Google and Twitter are doing an impressive job ofpushing back on censorship.  However the Googlefounders are increasingly invisible. Google CEO, Eric Schmidt has been heavily courted by the White House. Fortunately, Mr Schmidt seems to have his heart in the right place: Net Neutrality.Conclusion: Pay close attentionThere are some very smart people with control of massive resources that would like to see the Internet be put on a very short leash.  Don’t let it happen.  In particular, we should pay attention to (1) who controls the pricing and issuance of domain names, (2) who controls access to the internet, and (3) anything that touches the US Constitution.  The good news is that there are are lot of bright people — in the US and elsewhere — that have a vested interest in the web continuing its rapid expansion as a ubiquitous platform for the distribution of knowledge."
The Gini is out of the bottle	4-Dec-09	"TheGini coefficientis a topic that I expect we will be hearing a lot more about in the coming months.  For domainers, it is worth understanding because it is a reliable indicator of seismic changes in national economies.  It also happens to be good news for domainers.What is the Gini coefficientSimply described, the Gini coefficient is a mathematical index for income inequality. The coefficient has a value of between 0 and 1, where  1 represents complete inequality and 0 represents complete equality. Is this a useful statistic? The CIA uses the Gini coefficient as one predictive indicator of social unrest. If you look at adatabase of national Gini coefficients, you see some patterns. Countries like Switzerland, Sweden, Canada, and Japan have Gini coefficients in the range of .25 to .35. Countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa, and Argentina are all above 0.5.  For calibration, the US was just under 0.5 before the Great Recession, and is now probably at or above 0.5. This is troubling, particularly when you consider that this is nationalaverage.Should we care about income inequality?My wife,Jill, and I were out for dinner this evening. At one point, Jill asked the young server how it was going. To which, the college-aged man replied “I am doinggreat. Earning minimum wage …Living the American dream!” He said it with the type of cynical optimism that just tugged at your heart. People are frustrated, and increasingly vocal and upset. The tone is shifting from forward-looking hope to growing despair. As a right-leaning, serial entrepreneur, I am all for free markets but this is crazy. TheGiniis out of the bottle.  To put the Gini coefficient into historical context, here is a useful trendline:Gini coefficient in USAAnyone longing for the 60’s, may well be “Dreaming of Gini” — when the US experienced its lowest Gini coefficient in recorded history. Incidentally, the last time the US Gini coefficient was at 0.5 was in 1929 — the end of “The Roaring 20’s” and right before theGreat Depression. In other words, when the separation between “haves” and “have nots” gets this wide, the historical precedent is that a major intervention occurs.What’s a Government to do?The US Federal government is scrambling. This week’sJobs Summitwas a blatant appeal to the private sector for employment creation. Don’t hold your breath — these businesses are competing globally for customers and capital at a time when labor is plentiful.Keynesianpublic works projects are a replay of theFDRformula of the 1930’s — roads, bridges and public transportation. It worked well in the 1930’s. Yet, the situation is different this time. Why? Over the last 80 years, we have gone through 3 distinct cycles:1.Tax and spend—  TheNew Deal, under FDR, public works were funded through taxation. The term “Tax and Spend” comes from the FDR era. It worked.2.Borrow and spend— This was the growth formula under Reagan, Bush I and Bush II. Cut taxes, and borrow the difference. It too worked.3.Print and spend— The current practice ofQuantitative Easing, whereby the Federal Reserve “prints” currency which the US Treasury then borrows.The United States is executing the plan that looks rather similar toZimbabweand theWeimar Republic. For the moment, the US is getting away with it, in part because of the brand strength of the US dollar as international reserve currency, overwhelming military superiority of the US, andhat-in-hand diplomacyby our Commander in Chief. The following cartoon, courtesy of Ramsay Devreux, tells the story well:Looking ahead to 2010, Healthcare Reform, a lot more public works projects, more extended unemployment benefits, and now the surge in Afghanistan, will come at the cost of debasing the US Dollar since raising interest rates would just increase the deficit even faster. The alternative would be massive tax increases, notably on the rich. The problem this time around is that (1) the rich are a shrinking population, and (2) the truly rich hold capital that is not captive to the boundaries of any sovereign nation.  Wealth, and the people who control it, can live anywhere and work anywhere.Implications for domainersSo, what does rising inequality in the US mean for domainers.  If we get Great Depression II, I believedomains are a better store of value than currency.  However, in the more moderate U or W scenarios, I believe there are tectonic shifts in the value chain that are equally interesting for domainers. Here are a few examples:Products— As more products are sold online, more producers will go direct to consumers.  The US retail shakeout is far from over. During 2010, I expect that producers will be looking for more ways to sell directly to consumers.  Concerns about channel conflict will be trumped by the need to protect profit margins. Producers that are selling online through Amazon, Wal-Mart and Target, are getting squeezed by free shipping and price comparison. At what point do these producers start selling directly to consumers in a risky effort to regain pricing control? It will happen and when it does, these producers will need memorable, trademark-safe, SEO-friendly domain names on which to sell their products. Advantage: domainer.Content— Book publishers, Newspapers, TV and Radio are all feeling the heat. The cost of production and distribution has plummeted and now anyone can produce and distribute content. If it is good content, the world will discover it because social media has leveled the playing field.  Content producers no longer need printing presses or broadcasting towers to distribute content. However, once a content producer’s brand is established, why not take control of the online brand and host the content on your own domain name? Content producers — notably journalists and authors — are finally waking up to to this and the mainstreaming ofeReaderswill be a huge accelerant. Advantage: domainer.Professionals— The unemployment trend in 2009 has not bottomed yet. In normal economic cycles it would have bottomed by now. It has not. Jobs are still being lost on a monthly basis, though at a decelerating rate.  Sooner or later, people will realize that to an increasing degree we are living in the era of “You, Inc.”.  In a growing number of professions, providers will be better off selling their services directly to consumers. I actually expect this trend to accelerate in 2010.  These newly independent professionals will need their own websites through which to ply their trade. If they can’t get a great TrademarkAttorney.com, they might settle for a subdomain, e.g. Seattle.TrademarkAttorney.com. Advantage: domainer.In summary, I believe the real path out of rising inequality is not more taxation or more public works. It is entrepreneurial courage by capable producers who are currently underutilized.  The Founding Fathers of the United States knew this well:“A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.”—Thomas Jefferson, Founding Father and 3rd President of the United States (1801-1809)"
Cliff Beer joins Epik as CFO and General Counsel	24-Nov-09	"I am pleased to announce thatCliff Beerhas joined Epik as Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel. Cliff and I go way back.  Cliff joined my previous company,Global Market Insite (GMI)in 2000. He was with GMI from 2000 to 2006, during which time we grew annual sales from $3 million to $60 million. GMI could not have done it without him.Cliff is a rare talent.  He is a talented CFO, a strong attorney, as well a quality guy with high integrity.  As a CFO, Cliff spent part of his career in venture capital and also presided over three rounds of venture financing at GMI. As an attorney, Cliff is well equipped to support the company’s growing needs in terms of dealmaking, intellectual property, and corporate governance.We’ll make sure to get Cliff out to a domain conference so he can begin to learn the industry first-hand.  I also expect he will be connecting with the leading legal experts in our industry as he comes up to speed. Thanks in advance for welcoming Cliff to the domain industry. You can read more about Cliffhere, or contact him at cliff (at) epik.com."
The Times They are A-Changin’	22-Nov-09	"Over the weekend, I had an opportunity to catch up on some reading.  A few of the articles I read were particularly helpful to understand what is going on in the world. The first 3 articles are also related to my recent posts aboutChinaand the outlook for theUS dollar. The last article  falls into the category of Christian theology and offers interesting perspective on the outlook for the US dollar, and by inference, for domain names as a global asset class.Advice from GrandmaThomas “The World is Flat” Friedman’slatest Op-Ed piecestarts to throw cold water on the wholePacific Centurythesis saying that the US remains an innovation powerhouse and will come back. He then back-pedals and says that globalization has made the US sovereign borders less relevant, and goes on to draw a parallel between Arnold Schwarzenegger’s roll in governing thede factobankrupt State of California, and President Obama’s declining credibility as savior of US global hegemony:“A lot of the disappointment settling in among Obama voters today is prompted by their dawning realization that maybe, like Arnold, he can’t.”This is notable because Mr. Friedman is a respected pundit who has supported Obama in the past. The next 2 months leading up to the January State of the Union address to Congress are pivotal for the Presidency and Democratic-controlled Congress.United States Economy At Zero Hour To Service Debt MountainSimply stated,the articlemakes the case that the world largest importer is approaching an impasse with the largest exporters.  The formula that worked brilliantly for the past decade is starting to crack.Many countries that relied heavily on exports as a growth strategy are now geared up to provide goods and services to heavily indebted countries that no longer have the will or the means to buy them.The article includes some useful trend charts, and draws some parallels between the US in the 2000’s and the Japanese in the 1990’s. Having lived in Japan, I would draw some distinctions between the US and Japan: (1) The Japanese cultural norm is one where there is a huge social duty to pay one’s bills in full and on time.  In fact, Japan is still mostly a cash economy. (2) Japan  maintained a healthy export machine while moderating its imports.  And (3) the Japanese never had the luxury of producing an international reserve currency.Gold Market Reaching The Breaking PointI received this article from domainer — and fellow skeptic of fiat curency — Ramsay Devreux with whom we are developing names likeEmergencyFood.com,ModelShips.com, among other active projects.  The article raises some familiar questions about the accounting of physical gold.  It is almost 100% certain that a lot of physical gold has been sold multiple times, and that if everyone who owns physical gold actually took delivery on the gold they think they own, there would be a run on gold. While it was never the intent for a physical commodity to get levered, it turns out that it was. Here is an interesting visual from the article:All the gold that has ever been produced would fit in a solid cube of about 19 meters on each side, and this cube is only expanding by about 12 centimeters a year (2%).I also thought this statistic to be telling:Statistics from United States Geological Survey show that the united states hasexported 5000 metric tons of “Gold compounds”in last two years, and the US Census Bureau has assigned an astronomically high value to these exports.One emerging conspiracy theory is that the “compounds” are composite of Tungsten, which conveniently has the same density as gold, but costs just $10 perpound, versus $1,030 per ounce forgold.  That’s one reason why some people are buying older numismatic gold and silver coins that were produced long before there was a need to “inflate” physical gold.The Coming EpiphanyI came across a slightly dense eBook that is worth a read.  The book is  a primer on Christian End times theology. Revelations is pretty hard to parse due to heavy symbolism.  This book does a decent job of interpreting Scripture though it makes for slightly gloomy reading. Page 251 addresses the author’s academic analysis for why he thinks February 22, 2010 is judgment day for the US Dollar. You can download the eBook for freehereat Lulu.com, the self-publishing platform."
DVD-Copier: closing auction for a developed website	22-Nov-09	"A quick heads up for a closing auction.DVD-Copier.comis a developed website that we produced on the Wishpot platform.  The site went live 10 days ago and has now been indexed by Google.  The Estibot appraisal for the domain alone is$7,000.  The bidding for theentire websiteis currently at just $50, and includes the hosted website with original content.There is one piece of unfinished business with this website. The Q&A feature on the top-nav is not yet in production. This will go online next week. To see an example of what this looks like, check out what we deployed to HardDrives.com with the newQ&A feature. The new Q&A feature is also available on a stand-alone basis through a product calledEpik | Q&A. More on this soon.For awareness, the Product portals have been Epik’s hottest sellers. We have already produced nearly 200 product portals in the last 8 weeks. The normal setup fee for these sites is $249. We originally developed DVD-Copier.com for our own account. Since there is already one submitted bid, we have no choice but to let the auction run.And for the record, Epik will never (ever) shill bid. Also, once an auction listing has at least one bid, it is our policy that we will let the auction run its  course, even if it means that the item is sold for below fair market value.  The implication is that there will be some domains that will sell for bargain prices. I consider it an investment in the long term success of the Epik auction platform.The auction listing ishere.Also, a few more upcoming auctions forproduct portalsthat have been developed:Answering-machines.com– Currentbidis at $150.Compact-digital-cameras.com– Currentbidis at $149.And for the Twilight fans, we haveForks-Washington.com.  My wife is actually from there so we get to that town regularly to visit the in-laws.  Been there, seen the movie, bought the domain name."
The Pacific Century	21-Nov-09	"This past week was historic.  For the first time in probably a century, the President of the United States was not the most important person in the room.  As a US citizen — albeit of Dutch blood — this is not exactly the easiest thing to watch unfold. While troubling on one level, it just might be good news for domainers with a global view.Oh my, the US President bowing down to Japan’s Emperor Akihito -- this is the son of Emperor Hirohito of WW II!My first encounter with the Pacific Century was in 1994In 1994, I was based just outside of Frankfurt, Germany in the town of Schwalbach working for Procter & Gamble. My boss in Germany was a Polish-American named Jacek Kedziora. Jacek had just moved to Japan. We had a successful run working together in Europe.  When he invited me to come work for him again in Asia, I jumped at the chance. I moved to Kobe, Japan in January 1995, a few weeks after theGreat Hanshin Earthquake. Kobe was ground zero.Although the next 5 years were pretty demanding, working with the Japanese was an amazing experience as was traveling throughout Asia.  By 1997, I was working on some of P&G’s first global projects while still based in Kobe.  By 1999, I had become a global expert on developing better baby diapers having developed them for every region of the world, including Latin America. Around the same time, it was becoming increasingly apparent that the Internet was going to transform a lot of industries.In 1999, most people in Asia had no idea about the Internet. I developed the idea of creating an internet company that would address the challenge of conducting multi-country market research surveys using the web as the platform for collecting survey data. The idea forGlobal Market Insitewas born. I quit my day job on June 12, 1999, moved the family to Seattle, and then spent the summer of 1999 teaching myself Linux, Apache, MySQL and Perl, wrote the first version of the software, and filed 5 patents.The decision to be based in Seattle was not an accident. Seattle has an important geographic advantage that I think many people have yet to realize. Seattle is about 8 hour flying time to Tokyo, 9 hours to London and about a 5 hour red-eye to the US east coast. In other words, in the Pacific Century, Seattle is a reasonably central location from which to build global companies that would be well-positioned to bridge the gap with emerging Asia, and in particular, Japan and China.In economic terms, China is crushing itChina’s foreign exchange reserves hit $2.2 trillion in the 3rd quarter. While this number is huge, in all likelihood it understates the reality. The official pace of growth of foreign exchange reserves is on the order of $600 billion per year. That is actually what is left over after actually spending a large portion of the inflows.Message in a cookie: How do you expect to pay back all the money you're borrowing from us?A lot of this foreign exchange is held in US dollar denominated assets.  The Chinese have kept the Yuan pegged to the dollar at around 6.83 Yuan/Dollar since December 2008. The next big exchange rate reset is coming, likely after the Chinese New Year in January. In theory, the US administration wants and needs this revaluation of the Yuan. The downside for China is that it represents a step-wise discounting of the US debt, and will create further margin pressure on US importers of Chinese goods.The revaluation writing is on the wall. China’s purchases of US Treasuries has alreadypeaked. Moreover, the most recent purchases are short-term, in spite of the anemic interest rate of short-term US treasuries. The US will have no choice but to ask the US Federal Reserve to print currency in order to pay the debt. This practice is calledMonetizing the debt. It is among the more blatant forms ofQuantitative Easing.So, what is China doing with all those extra dollars that it no longer wants to hold?China is buying vast amounts of arable land, notably inAfrica.   The headfake here is that this is supposedly about securing the national food supply. In reality, the domestic food supply risk becomes a factor in about2030based on current projections. That alone would not justify buying 2.8 million hectares of sub-Saharan arable land. They are dumping dollars.China has been accumulating insane amounts of strategic metals.  Unlike theHunt brothers’ famous attempt to corner the silver market, China could actually corner just about any market they chose.  Thelatest acquisition binge has focused on copper.  Recent dollar shopping sprees have included other strategic metals, includingaluminum, nickel, titanium and zincAnd not to be outdone by India, China continues to add to itsstockpile of goldandsilver.What are the implications for DomainersThe twilight of the American century, and the start of the Pacific century is not the end of the world, and certainly not for the prepared domainer.  Unlike physical real estate which has a finite number of potential users or acquirers, domains can be accessed by any of the nominally 1.7 billion users on the internet in a near-instant.  The universe of potential buyers for a given domain name is similarly global.  What are some things that domainers can do to thrive in the Pacific Century?Design global websites:  Founded in December 2007, Patents.com serves a global audience of nearly 1 million monthly visitors.  The site was designed to be global from day one because the addressable market for intellectual property is already global — to the tune of $500 billion per year.  Patents.com started out with a focus on global patent search. In the next phase, we’ll layer on efficient ways for global IP licensing and sale.Learn to work with the Asians:  The Chinese term ofGuanxiis not so different than the Japanese practice ofnemawashi. Unlike the US, it takes a long time to build a commercially meaningful business relationship with a Chinese or Japanese partner. This can be a good thing if you are willing to invest the time to understand the cultural norms and differences.Partner with Asia-based businesses: Epik recently agreed to develop 3 language-related domains — Japanese.com, German.com and Russian.com — in partnership withBrian Gilbert of Innovation HQ.  The first one to get developed will be Japanese.com using technology and content sourced from World Friends Network, a Shanghai based social network group that I first met in 2007.  The company is led by the talented founder and CEO,Dominic Penaloza.Experiment with Drop-Ship:  As the international supply chain gets more efficient, I expect Chinese producers to start looking at ways to cut out the middle-man, a.k.a. WalMart and Amazon.com.  As part of this transition, I am convinced that there is a meaningful business opportunity to combine a network ofproduct portalswith an international drop-ship supply chain. Epik has released more than 150 product portals in the last 6 weeks and is producing new ones at the rate of 30-40 per week. And at $249 one-time setup fee, it is a domain development bargain.In summary, I believe we have just experienced a seismic shift in the global economy.  What many economists predicted in the 1990’s is now a reality: the torch of global economic leadership passed to Asia — and specifically China — last week in Beijing at theGreat Hall of the People.  The global Internet will be too important for China not to have a global strategy. How much longer before the Chinese start to acquire significant amounts of the raw land of the Internet? My prediction: it is coming in 2010."
Deal Friday	13-Nov-09	"Quick heads up.  Epik’sdomain auction platformis out of beta. There are a couple of domain auctions that are closing later today which I think are interesting. They also happen to be bargain-priced.ShakeFlashlights.comis a domain that we acquired on the drop on November 5 using Epik’s integrated backorder platform.  We paid reg-fee for a domain thatEstibot appraises for $8,800.  Theauctionbid is at $49 and closes in about 2 hours from now.InkJetCartridge.comis a developed website. It went live earlier this week as part of the growing base of product portals that are being produced on theEpik | Product platform. The auction listing ishere.The Epik drop-catch platform keeps improving. We are consistently outgunning Godaddy now — about 100% of the time. This will be the subject of an upcoming post. We are excited to bring some innovation to this part of the domain value chain.In addition, the Epikdomain auction platformkeeps improving. Thechat featurehas been viewed as a positive innovation. In the interest of transparency, we also provide full auditability of all bids, and all bidder profiles.Feedback welcome."
Boom! Why domains are better than dollars	10-Nov-09	"The Sage of Omaha is a pretty smart guy. He also may be the ultimate insider trader who happens to be tight withLloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs,Barack Obama,Bill and Melinda Gates, and pretty much anyone else in the world with a major part in the global economic theater. Pay attention to his latest moves and you will know why domains are better than dollars.These guys are tight!For the purposes of this post, I will steer far clear of geopolitical conspiracy theories involving Buffett and just focus on the substance of the moves that Buffett has just made. I will also add my own perspective on why I think it matters to domainers, which may be entirely wrong.My first introduction to Buffett was in 1984As a youth, I was a stock trading fanatic. I began trading stocks at age 12. My entire room was lined with hand-drawn point and figure charts culled from data downloaded from Dow Jones News Retrieval on an Apple II. I remember my Dad — Willem Monster, a University professor in biomedical technology at the time — arranging an opportunity to go meet with the CEO of a public company (United Medical). I grilled the then CEO, a guy by the name of John Aglialaro. After the meeting, I bought the stock after sensing bullishness that I thought the analysts had not picked up on. Within a few months, I sold the shares for a very tidy return. I was hooked. I was mowing lawns and delivering newspapers, and then investing the proceeds in stocks, options and even tried trading commodities until I got my ass kicked by mistiming an expected market move!By the time I was 17 years old, I was pretty sure that I wanted to pursue a career in finance or investment banking. I had an opportunity to work on the floor of the American stock exchange as part of ahigh schoolculminating project. For 6 weeks, I lived as houseguest in Brooklyn with aHasidic Jewnamed Joel, who is a cousin of one of our long-time neighbors, the Weinbaums. I  commuted from Brooklyn to Wall Street on the RR train to work as a Specialist’s clerk for two seasoned traders — Jerry Greenwald and Russ Ingallinera. Besides experiencing life on Wall Street and a developing a taste forknish,  I  remember learning three pearls of wisdom from the old hands on the trading floor: (1)Don’t fight the Fed, (2)Bulls and Bears make money, but Pigs get slaughtered, and (3)Never, ever bet against Warren Buffett!Buffett just bet hugely on a RAILROADFor anyone who does not know, Buffett’s main investment vehicle is a company calledBerkshire Hathaway. I have never owned the stock, but have always respected the man. Buffett described the latest investment in theBNSF Railroadas “An all-in bet on America’s future“.  Got that? One of the most connected and wealthiest guys, who is now in the twilight of his professional career, has just made an enormous financial wager on a railroad! What’s special about this railroad?  There are analysts who have theorized that it is really an energy play. This for two reasons that are discernible: (1) rail is more energy efficient than road for transport, and (2) this particular railroad isconnected to one of the largest coal deposits in the world.Railroad monopolies have worked brilliantly before.They were ultimately broken up for Antitrust reasons. However, Obama and Congress are on board with Buffett and coal so I would say not likely to see Antitrust rumblings.  Why? TheCap and Trade bill passedand this means a big new federal tax on energy-induced emissions. In other words, the Fed will get a big kickback on coal-based energy until all the emerging clean energy technologies can be developed and deployed.My interpretation for domainers: The next oil shock is coming, possibly triggered byIsrael crossing swords with Iran. Throw in a blockade of theGulf of Adenand/or theStraits of Hormuz, and you have a1973-style oil shock. However, unlike 1973, this oil shock will finally put a knife in the longstanding US dependence on imported oil.  That is good news for electric cars,electric trains, and coal fired power plants, in part because solar and wind energy arenot ready for national prime timeand nuclear energy is politically a hot potato.  A  global oil crisis would be good news for the internet since in the immediate aftermath of an oil shock, the consumer will be ordering online and working from home rather than driving to the mall or the office. Timing? After theSenate passes the Healthcare billand well before the 2012 election.Buffett borrows big, split his stock 50:1, all while India buys 200 tons of goldTofinance the deal to buy BNSF, Berkshire Hathway is borrowing $10 billion, by assuming debt on the balance sheets of BNSF plus borrowing another $8 billion.  The man who historically has eschewed debt, now has a large dollar short position in his portfolio.  Also, in case, you missed it, Berkshire Hathaway’s stock just got affordable for everyman; the stock isexpected to split 50:1. This is unprecedented. Buffett is 79 years old. He waited this long to split his stock. This coincides with the Fed decision toleave Fed funds at effectively zerowhile theofficial unemployment rate soars past 10%, and theunofficial employment rate goes past 20%. And to top it off, almost on the same day,India bought a huge amount of gold from the IMF, effectively a vote of no-confidence on the US dollar as a store of value.My interpretation for domainers:  While the pattern will not be a straight line, stocks are heading higher for now.  The effective policy of the Fed and Treasury appears to be to force cash off the sidelines by creating moral hazard for anyone sitting on paper currency for too long. Thevelocity of moneywill increase because the “risk ofomission” (aka, do nothing) is going to be greater than the “risk ofemission” (aka, do something).  This is good news for domainers, especially those with premium, English language .com names, because (1) domains can be priced in any currency, (2) owned by anyone, and (3) operated from anywhere. As a result, I believe this will be an opportune time to practice capital efficientdomain development.It was the best of times, it was the worst of timesSo starts the Charles Dickens classic,A Tale of Two Cities.  The tale takes place around the time of the French Revolution — yes, another major war time in history.  Those who knew what was coming, and had prepared, were living fat.  Those who did not were as poor as poor can be.  Today, I know domainers that are not renewing great domains because nobody is bidding on them at Sedo, and because their parking revenues are down 70%. Choosing between beans for the family and a domain renewal? That’s nuts. If you own a domain name with more than 1,000 monthly keyword searches per month that is not trespassing on somebody’s trademark, and has keyword-related PPC advertising, you have a development candidate. Consider doing some modest development of the domain, and then sell it to a retail buyer who is late to the party with executing their own online strategy. These opportunities are out there and thetools for doing thisare getting better and better. I call this practice “Build – Operate -Transfer”, the subject of myprevious post.Why does selling domains — and starter websites — to end-clients really matter now? As I see it, one end-client sale of even a weak website should generateat least$1,600, which is about Sedo’s average domain sale based on latest reports by management at theSedo Pro conference. This is consistent with other reports, including byRon Jackson, where the range has been from $1300 to $2500 per domain.  More importantly, developed websites that have some traction in the market, usually sell for vastly more. The financial implication to a cash-strapped domainer of a single $1600 sale is the ability to renew 200-250 domains at a renewal price of ~$6.50 to $8.  So, by being a little scrappy with site development, the domainer has just added one full year to their runway to achieve an even more meaningful exit on a whopping 200-250 other valuable domains that can be sold or developed in the upcoming bull run in domains. In other words, the leverage is enormous.And that is a partial explanation for why I am excited to be developing domains in 2009.  Sorry for the long post."
Ka-Ching Chapter 2:  Build – Operate – Transfer	6-Nov-09	"The blog post entitledKa-chingwas a popular one and continues to get reactions and comments.  It described where I believe money is being made on the internet, and by inference, which types of domain names might be worth owning and monetizing through development. The Ka-Ching #1 post did not explain a key aspect of monetization, namely the exit, or sale, of a developed domain. Real estate development and nuclear power plants offer a possible template to follow.The concept of“Build, Operate, Transfer”is one that I first came across in the context of large facility construction, such as nuclear power plants. The skills required to plan and build such a facility are far more specialized and expensive than the ones required to operate or maintain such facilities.  The same logic could apply to homebuilding. Most people will never build their own home. Rather, most people will buy an existing home, or work with a builder, and then handle post-construction enhancements like landscaping, interior design, and general “curb appeal”.So, since most people will never build their own home, it begs the question, why should domain development be any different?  Why would a domainer, with little or no experience with building commercial websites, take on the risk of building a site, let alone hundreds or thousands of them. With the recent chatter about minisites, and all of theirlimitations, I believe the model of “Build, Operate, Transfer” may emerge as a superior alternative.  Rather than speculate on whether or not a commissioned minisite will work, a buyer is acquiring a developed site that is ready for monetization and further development, preferably with an integrated content management system so that the entire site is turn-key for the new owner without further investment or technical work.Anatomy of a Deal: TripodAdapter.comOn August 16, 2009, Epik acquired the domain nameTripodAdapter.comon the drop.  The name was acquired through theJustDropped.com backorder servicewhich is now in full production using a network of registry connections. During October, Epik produced a site using theWishpotcomparison shopping platform. We are now producing sites like TripodAdapter.com by the dozens each week as turn-key businesses that are ready to scale.In the meantime, TripodAdapter.com isnow at auction.  The auction ends on Saturday morning.  The auction listing has now been viewed more than 1200 times. Since announcing that TripodAdapter.com is for sale, I fielded a few questions about the auction listing, so here are a few clarifying points about the TripodAdapter.com auction. After all, I believe we’ll be selling a lot more like this one:What are we selling?The auction listing is for both the domain and the operating website, which is hosted by Epik’s operating partner, Wishpot.com.  This is a turn-key comparison shopping portal.What is the SEO status of the site?TripodAdapter.com is on the middle of page 1 ofGoogle’s SERPfor the termTripod Adapter.Can the buyer use their own ad feeds?Yes, the buyer of the site can use their own feeds from Amazon.com, Shopping.com and Google. Epik/Wishpot can continue to host the site in order to provide cross-links and software updates.Can the buyer get the source code for the site?The buyer of TripodAdapter.com receives a license of the source code for operating the current site on the domain TripodAdapter.com.In summary, the model of Build – Operate – Transfer can apply to domains.  By using aplatform-based approach to domain development, Epik aims to work with domain owners to  quickly develop domains into commercially viable websites.  In the coming months we aim to shorten the development cycle from acquisition to exit to an average of less than 90 days for the domain categories where we have a platform-based solution."
The $8 billion dollar question	4-Nov-09	"Rick Schwartz served up anotherprovocative postthis week and then chased it today withanother— suggesting that Microsoft should acquire a very large cross-section of the most valuable domains for the princely sum of at least $8 billion.  The $8 billion dollar question is does Microsoft have a domain strategy.  As near as I can tell, they don’t.  At the New York City TRAFFIC conference, it seemed to me that the primary Microsoft strategy was to SELL their ~45,000 domains.While I don’t agree with Rick’s big bang approach, I agree with Rick that Microsoft desperately needs a domain name strategy.  As for the $8 billion price tag, that sounds about right if the goal was to secure a monopoly.  However, there is actually no need to own all of the best raw land. I believe it is possible to integrate domain names into the Bing search strategy, and that this can be done even without owning all the names. In particular, where I believe these two themes converge is in the area ofvertical search.Why Microsoft needs a vertical search strategyGoogle is no Netscape.  Microsoft will not topple Google in the head-on way they creamed Netscape in thebrowser wars.  Microsoft is about even with Google (and Apple) in terms of raw intellect, user footprint, access to capital, and brand strength.  There is no sustainable competitive advantage visible in Microsoft’s current search strategy and market share seems to bestalled at 10%. This is where domain names can help. Domains are ownable and defensible. And with the proliferation of TLDs, it would be hard to lose an antitrust suit. Domains can power an unbeatable vertical search strategy.With a large network of domains — all powered by Bing’s search engine — Microsoft has executed the ultimate “Pincer Movement” on Google’s one-size-fits-all approach to search. With the volume of content on the web exploding it will become impossible for Google to do justice to every topic. The algorithm will fail because Google will not be able to organize enough human editors to police the content. To address this, I believe community will need to converge with algorithm to determine what content is worth indexing — and which editors are worth trusting — and organize the web in ways that become intuitive so you can find what you want when you want it. The outcome is predictable because we live in exponential times — the classic video is here:﻿﻿﻿Is Microsoft playing offense or defense?So why exactly did Microsoft launch Bing?  Did they do it with the goal of winning in search, or did they do it to punish Google for crossing swords with theMicrosoft Officecash machine withGoogle Docs.  If the goal was to win versus Google, one would expect Microsoft to apply overwhelming force. The $100 million in ad spend on top of a me-too search engine is not exactly putting nails in the coffin.  Bing 1.0 feels more like Zune or Windows Vista than it feels like Xbox or Internet Explorer. However, don’t count Microsoft out. They are famously a 3.0 company, i.e. they tend to get it right by around the 3rd development cycle.So, in the spirit of getting it right on the 2nd or 3rd development cycle, here follows my unsolicited input on how Microsoft could increase the probability of being a top player in search by using domain names as a structural advantage.  The total down payment to execute this experiment would be not more than $250 million for openers.Acquire Dark Blue Sea: The entire portfolio of 400,000 names is now for sale for about $21 million net of cash on hand thanks to Proton’s $0.30/share offer. This seems woefully mispriced even if you value the operating business at zero. The portfolio is solid enough with healthy type-in traffic and high semantic value in the domain names. The Dark Blue Sea business comes complete with the Fabulous.com parking platform and the Domain Distribution Network.  Run the parking business at break-even for 12 months while helping domainers sell some domains. Watch the domain portfolios roll in.Acquire Tucows.com: If you are going to be a domain name power house, it pays to be a leading registrar.Newly-married Bob Parsonsmight be willing to sell Godaddy for a reasonable price … but probably NOT. Enom is locked up inside of Demand Media as the captive cash machine so also likely not for sale. This leaves Tucows.com as the eligible wallflower with~7 million domainsunder management and a decent base of quality names in their portfolio. Even at a 100% premium to the current  valuation, at ~$75 million (or 1X revenues) the buyer is getting the domain portfolio for free.Build out a network of vertical portals: The consumer is already using vertical search engines. They are calledExpedia(travel),Amazon(products) andWhitePages.com(people). However, this is just the beginning of vertical search. The mid-tier is wide open.Patents.com,Karate.com,Dive.com,WiFi.com,Dining.com,Questions.com,Clothing.com,Bookstore.com,Haircare.com,Park.com, andAlerts.comare some of the examples of sites in development across Epik.Populate parked domains with queryless search:  Beyond the vertical portal domains, there is the long tail of descriptive domains. What Epik is doing bypopulating domains with contentcould be replicated with Bing. In effect, Epik is building a queryless search platform by mapping content according to a semantic ontology. Parked domains could become queryless searches, powered by Bing. This applies not only to reference content, but also to products as Epik has started to do with the launch of theproduct portal platform, e.g.HardDrives.comas well asdescriptive names, etc.Integrate Single-sign-on: Federated content needs single-sign-on. Facebook Connect, Twitter Oauth, and OpenID are all fine.  Google is ahead of Microsoft here: the Gmail sign-in works portably across the Google Apps platform. Now that the consumer is getting over the privacy concerns, the missing ingredient is a strategy that ties together the various sign-on methods to a unified and permanent identity. This is in essence the objective of theIdentity.net single-sign-on APIwhich is now in operation across more than 1 million (mostly Epik) sites.Will Microsoft execute a domain name strategy that integrates vertical search?  Who knows.  If they don’t, someone else will.  I say this because I am sure of two things: (1)  As hard as it might be to imagine today, Google will not be the last word in content discovery, and (2) Domains as an addressing system will be around longer than Google will be around as an independent company. Will the industry see a multi-billion dollar domain name rollup that Rick envisions? If anational railway goes for $44 billion— ostensibly to move coal — the global internet will ultimately sell formore.Interested in being part of the ultimate global vertical search strategy using domains names?

TRAFFIC NYC Keynote: The impact of social media	27-Oct-09	"Greetings from the TRAFFIC conference in NYC where theRickLatona.comauction has wrapped up, and the evening function — sponsored bySkenzo— is starting.Earlier today, the conference delegates at TRAFFIC heard from CNN News personality,Rick Sanchez, who addressed the group with lunchtime keynote. The central theme of Rick’s unscripted (and unfiltered) speech can be described as being about how social networks are transforming the news from being abroadcastto being adialog.  Of particular note, Rick reported that the audience for his mid-afternoon news broadcast is up some 73% during his tenure. This is a rare growth story in broadcast television news. He attributes much of this growth to his integration of Twitter, Facebook and Myspace.This raises the question howwebsitescan engage a dialog with an audience in a way that extends beyond the website.  Email newsletters (Web 1.0) and RSS feeds (Web 2.0) are still widely used. However, the virality of both of these methods is predicated on active forwarding of content through  word of mouth or “pass along”.   In Web 3.0, we will see a much greater emphasis on “user syndication” which is one-to-one (personal communication) but also one-to-many (broadcast).  In the example of Rick Sanchez, he might broadcast out on Facebook or Twitter and the audience Tweets or emails back.At Epik, we are beginning to experiment with integrating social media into our content network. Here are two current examples:Online polling using Twitter OAuthWe have begun to integrate polling with social syndication.  This is made possible through an exclusive partnership with Switzerland-basedPollPigeon.com— a company with social media roots.  To see how this works, you can try outthis poll.  If you vote in the poll, your vote is counted by logging in with your Twitter ID (OAuth to be specific) or Facebook. Your poll response is then inserted into your Twitter stream or onto your Facebook wall. We are experimenting with embedded social polls in a few other areas, including the upcomingWhoWoreItBest.comwhich ties in with the new directory portalClothing.com.  WhoWoreItBest.com will be a social experiment to see how consumers might participate in this act of user syndication.  An iPhone application is in the planning.Community WidgetsI believe thatsingle-sign-onis going to be a huge positive for domainers.  The more that people can take their identity, preferences and reputation with them, the easier it is for new sites to grow audience rapidly, and virally.  In the past, most sites, had their own user-registration databases. Meanwhile,OpenID,Facebook ConnectandTwitter OAuthopen up the possibility of letting the user take their identity with them, and along with their identity comes their social graph — the other people with whom they are connected online.The above example is taken from an Epik-powered fan site calledMitchelMusso.comwhere we recently added a Facebook widget, and where we have seen steady growth in the fan base. When a user adds themselves as a fan, it appears on their personal wall, which in turn virally introduces the site to other persons. This concept will be more broadly deployed across theEpik network of reference portals.Do journalists get social media?During the Q&A of today’s TRAFFIC keynote, David Castello asked the question that I was about to ask, namely who owns the brand “Rick Sanchez”, and the related question of who owns RickSanchez.com. Well, it turns out that CNN has licensed the rights to “Rick Sanchez” as television news personality. As for the domain name, an insurance broker in Miami owns it. My conclusion from this is thatjournalistshave yet to take control of their online brands.  The day is coming when the traditional media will be forced to compete with the growing capability for online media to provide a comprehensive platform for real-time journalism. The odds are that you won’t read about in your local paper, but the seismic shift in journalism appears to be far from complete."
Ka-Ching	23-Oct-09	"For clues as to who is making money during the economic downturn, take a look at the quarterly earnings reports for Amazon and NetFlix. Read to the end of this post to see how domainers can ride the same wave.Amazon crushes it and Netflix impressesIn case you missed the news today, Amazon reported quarterly revenues of $5.45 billion. The companycrushedthe analyst estimates on earnings.  The stock rocketed to a new all-time high:On the same day, Netfliximpressed analystswith the apparent traction of their streaming product and the continued traction of the traditional DVD-by-mail product. The cable companies should have had the on-demand video business in the bag but Netflix has a brand and a superior platform for social discovery of movie selection.  Netflix stock also popped to a new high today.Why this matters to domainersThe Netflix result was not entirely unpredictable —  consumers are still hurting, so they are staying home and watching more movies. In past downturns,physical world theaters were so-called counter-cyclical plays. During the present economic downturn, the traditional theaters are competing with (1) dirt cheap DVDs that are being liquidated by retailers in the head-long run to higher margin Blu-Ray, and (2) video on demand made possible by cheap broadband.  By comparison, $5 for theater popcorn does not look so rational! Result: traffic for NetFlix is UP,  Fandango (a proxy for theater traffic) is DOWN, Blockbuster is BIG-TIME DOWN:In the aggregate,the offline economy is still hurting but the online economy is not.This is just the beginning — much of traditional retail is still on the wrong side of historyAs commentedpreviously, I am absolutely convinced that the web remains the most efficient platform for commerce. Business models are getting crushed by well-executed web strategies and the noose is tightening.  The clothing vertical is particularly ripe for further reinvention.  Amazon knew this when theyacquired Zappos.com.  For more insight into Amazon’s philosophy, and Bezos’ logic for the deal, check out this video from Bezos himself:To see why many traditional mid-market clothing retailers are toast, consider this story. Last weekend my wife,Jill, went to take our oldest boy, Klaas, out for some clothes shopping. Klaas has a 36″ inseam which apparently is a problem for mainstream retail who apparently no longer carry that size.  So they ordered the product online while at the store.  The product has not arrived yet.  In other words, traditional retail is not only weakening their offline presence by reducing SKUs, their online logistics are still far from benchmark (Amazon).  The consumer will figure this out. As traditional retailers drop SKUs and reduce service, consumers will initiallycomplain, and then they will simply go elsewhere.Why is this good news for domainers?What Zappos did in online shoes is a repeatable model onthe long tail. The big difference now is that today it can be done with a lot less capital.  What most people don’t realize is that Zappos actually raised a ton of outside capital. Their last round was aSeries F round.  For those who don’t know venture rounds, a typical VC-backed company might go through a Series A, B and C rounds in order to get to positive operating cashflow with high revenue growth. In other words, Zappos required a tremendous amount of capital to build an online shoe store.  These days domainers can build an affiliate store for almost nothing. Think I’m kidding? Epik has just rolled out the first wave of online stores using a platform-based approach made possible through an exclusive partnership with Seattle-basedWishpot.com. While it is still early in the evolution of this jointly operated platform, it is a very efficient way to build new retail portals that offer consumers both selection and price. Here are a few of the first sites to go online:harddrives.comtennisrackets.comflapper-dress.comflightattendantcostumes.comadultwitchcostumes.compocahontascostumes.comhalloweencostumesforbaby.combikinis.netPearlEarrings.comsterlingsilverheartlocket.comrosependant.comipodstereo.comCompactSpeakers.combluetoothphoneheadset.comereaders.netaudiobookdirectory.comtripodadapter.cominternet-security-software.comlanguage-translation-software.comcomputerlapdesk.comidetousb.comrcatousb.comSOCKET939MOTHERBOARD.COMduallayerdvdburner.comcomputer-batteries.compc-notebooks.comwireless-printers.comnetwork-switches.comHow domainers can get startedBusinesses like Zappos are clearly not built overnight. That said, it does not have to cost a fortune to test the water. For starters, you can do what Epik network member Kenny Hartog is doing.  Kenny loaded a few product-related domain names onto Epik earlier this month.  We then produced online stores for him at no cost. Kenny is now watching his earnings ramp fast. Here is Kenny’s revenue share as reported on his metrics portal:What is notable is that most of Kenny’s traffic is coming from search:Thanks for sharing, Kenny.Some of Kenny’s stores will get queued for development into custom store formats like the ones described earlier. The product platform that we are developing allows us to go beyond affiliate feeds to work directly with manufacturers, wholesalers and dropship networks. This means that as volume grows it is possible to increase gross margins as well as take greater control of the customer relationship both within the individual store, but also across the network of stores.Got product domains?

Epik Pro – Power tools for domain development	22-Oct-09	"Domain development is a popular topic these days in the domainer community.  Domainers with large portfolios have the challenge of having to develop and maintain a number of sites. For large portfolios there has historically been little or no economies of scale. After all, to get any sustainable traction, each domain had to be hand-crafted, developed and maintained.  Along came minisites  as the would-be panacea.  Maybenot.Some of the main challenges with minisites include:High up-front costs:  A decent minisite from one of the established providers costs $200-300.  The ad-based income on a “successful” minisite might average $1 a day.  So, after month 1, the domain owner is $170-270 in the hole for each site produced.Poor maintainability: Once a site is built, that is just the beginning.   As Rick Schwartz posted recently,a mini-site is really a mini-business. Anyone who launches a minisite needs to look ahead to the larger plan which is hard to do if executed as a one-off investment by a contractor.Stale content: Because most mini-sites are sold as a static site, any SEO win is likely to be fleeting since ranking on search engines is predicated on demonstrating a commitment to justify that top ranking through superior content.  The competition is innovating and so must you.Epik Pro – Power tools for domain developmentWe are announcing Epik Pro just in time forTRAFFIC NYC(see you there?).

Depression-era domaining is different	17-Oct-09	"The news ofJustDropped.comjoining forces with Epik has prompted a number of reactions in the domainer community.  It also raised some questions about Epik’s motivation to integrate drop-catching capability as a service offering and in particular whether we will continue to make domains available cheaply. The addition of JustDropped, preceded by the addition of theDNKO auction platform, also raised questions about Epik’s strategy.  This post — the first of many — will begin to answer these questions.One question that has come up a number of times relates to the topic of drop-catching and specifically can anyone beat the “big boys”, e.g. Snapnames, BuyDomains, Pool.  I think this is the wrong question.  The real question iswhat is the future of “abandoned domains”? To answer that question requires a discussion not only about strategy but also the macroeconomic factors that informed it. Briefly stated, I believe that a lot more domains will be abandoned, starting with the marginal TLDs, and expanding to the premium TLDs.Macroeconomic outlook — Kondratiev WinterAs context, I believe the current economic downturn is far from over.  Many economists believe that we are in what is referred to as aKondratiev Winter.  This is an economic super-cycle whereby the period of prosperity we just witnessed from 1982-2007 is likely followed by a period of recession (current) and then a depression (pending). This “shakeout” period is highly disruptive — what Joseph Schumpeter referred to as “Creative Destruction“. Business models get tested. Those who execute well, and adapt to the new climate, are able to persist.Never-ending deficits ultimately manifest themselves in the form of a weakening national currency. Thankfully domains can be priced in any currency.Consider for a moment that China’s foreign reserves have rocketed to an unfathomable $2 trillion while the US has racked up an equally unfathomable one year deficit of $1.4 trillion. This is seismic stuff. There will be aftershocks.  For anyone building a business, the success models and instincts that worked in 1982-2000 and 2002-2007 are not likely to be the same ones that will work in 2009-2020 and beyond. As entrepreneurs, we have to consider the scenario of a protracted downturn, potentially lasting a decade or longer.We are just getting started — some call it “FDR Redux”For Q2 2009, US GDP shrank by 1%.  The only reason why Q3 and Q4 will likely not be negative is because of massive government spending.  Remember your college economics class: C+I+G+(X-M).  Well, C (the consumer) is in the tank. It is the “G” that is carrying the water at the moment.Fed Beige Booknotwithstanding, the recession did not really end.  It was mathematically avoided through government stimulus.  Businesses know this which is why they arenot hiring.The ticking time bomb is that national economies of the US, EU and Japan, can’t continually fund government spending without inviting aworst case scenario.Downturns lead to efficiency and that’s a good thingSo what does a Kondtratiev Winter have to do with dropping domains? Turns out a whole lot — many domains will change hands during this cycle. Back in 2001-2002, you could buy a domain on the drop, wait for the recovery in 2003, and profit as the ad market boomed. This created wildly profitable domain parking businesses and entrepreneurial icons likeFrank Schilling. However, I believe this time will be different. The winning  model will likely not be the same one that worked during the last great buying opportunity, largely because the ad market will stay soft for some time.As it is, many domain owners are not covering their registration fees. Monetization from parking continues to fall as domainers bounce from one parking company to another. Some have experimented withminisites — usually not recouping their investment. To make matters worse, the likely next move for domain renewals fees is UP, not down.  As a result, I believe that cash flow forecasts that are predicated on a return to 2007 CPM levels with no change in annual registration costs are too optimistic.  Sure, selling domains in the interim can provide some offset against falling parking revenues. However, this is not a sustainable strategy.Epik’s strategy: capital-efficient domain developmentSo, how does Epik intend to weather the storm?  Simply put: capital efficient domain development using a platform-based approach.   Here are the main development themes:Directory portals:  Sites likeTanning.com,Karate.comandHaircare.comall use the same back-end platform. Traffic is growing 300+% per month through entirely organic methods.  We are adding new category directories at the rate of 2-4 per month.Clothing.com,Bookstore.comandDive.comwent live last week. Dining.com and Court.com should be live within 2 weeks. Each site gets fresh content added several times a week.Product portals:  The launch ofHardDrives.com2 weeks ago is part of a larger strategy. The platform behind it will improve steadily. We will release 10-50 new product portals per WEEK through an exclusive partnership withWishpot, a company I backed in 2007.  Wishpot will go way beyond using Shopping.com and Amazon.com feeds.  It will enable suppliers to directly list their SKUs through what is called asocial storefront.Reference portals:  In June we announced an exclusive deal withEvri.com.  The deal is delivering.  Thenetwork of reference portalshas grown to 630,000 topics in more than 600 categories.  By year-end, we expect this to be at 1.7 million sites. Wherever possible we want these portals to be run on the stand-alone domains that most logically map to the topic.  Otherwise, we’ll use an epik.com subdomain as a placeholder.Gloom and doom aside, I believe it is a great time to be a domainer. The web remains the most efficient platform for processing transactions — buying products, disseminating information, answering questions, making new friends, etc.  However, undeveloped domains — like raw land — are not all that economically useful. To extract value from the raw land, it has to be developed into something that is genuinely useful to some target audience whether it is something ridiculously simple likePostOfficeHolidays.comorOilPrices.com, or something way more complicated likePatents.com.The other major advantage of a platform approach to development is the ability to do intuitive cross-linking between related topics built around a unifiedsemantic ontology.  We have spent the last 4 months (June-September) building platforms, while adding production capacity in site hosting, content development, graphic design and project management. The factory is open for business!  We are also adding more features to the platforms and providing increased flexibility to power users — the upcoming launch of Epik Pro (powered byDevHub) will make this more clear.To build out the Epik network, Epik needs more domains.  It matters less to Epik who owns these domains. What matters more is that the domains are able to benefit from the massive network effect made possible by semantic cross-linking. Epik’s primary function is to provide the unified architecture, regardless of who owns the underlying domains.  However for the Epik network to be a win-win with domain owners, we know that Epik also has to bringliquidityto the domain economy, through a combination of short-term monetization and long-term value appreciation.It is my personal goal for Epik to earn the reputation of being “The Domainer’s best friend”.  Epik intends to provide domainers with many of the tools and services needed to thrive through the downturn with a primary emphasis on cost-effective domain acquisition, capital efficient domain development, and timely sale of developed websites through either private sale or public auction. The pieces of this enabling ecosystem are rapidly being assembled.   However, Epik can’t do it alone.  If you have not submitted your names, do it today by visiting ushere.  It’s free and there is no minimum commitment."
Cleaning up the web	14-Oct-09	"Therecent media attentionabout the Chris Bosh case is worth noting. While the case itself is not news, it is noteworthy because it raises public awareness around the alternative courses of action that are available beyond UDRP. It is also a reminder of the the potential consequence of registering a name in bad faith even where there is no registered trademark as is often the case with celebrities.The Epik network powers a number of person-related fan sites across several categories:actors,athletes,politicians, etc.  The notion of a “federated Wikipedia” that maps domains to relevant content is a core aspect of the Epik vision for the future of the web.  I view it as unfinished business related to the architecture of the namespace, and in particular the dot-com namespace.  I sometimes call this “Cleaning up the web”.Why does the web need to be cleaned up?  I believe that to a large extent the “original sin” was allowing first come, first serve registrations. This applies to any TLD.  There are even TLDs whose business model is heavily predicated on people and businesses reserving names just for the purposes of protecting their brand. That makes no sense to me. The namespace is polluted enough.  This is the main reason I am actuallyagainstnew TLDs.So, how can the domain community go about the process of cleaning up this mess? There are several proactive steps that can be taken.The Epik network has created a platform that matches what we believe to be authoritative content to domains.  If a domain matches the identity of a famous person, it is easy to know it.  Domainers can check their portfolios free of charge just by submitting the nameshere.The sites that get created about celebrities are evolving as we experiment with new templates. Here is atypical site.  It merges community,  content and relevant cross-linking.In some cases, Epik’s site has been named an “official fan site” by the subject matter of their site, or their authorized representative.  In all other cases, we include a footer that prominently states that the site is not affiliated with the celebrity.Once a fan site is live, any correspondence that comes to a fan site that appears to be intended for the celebrity is  routed onwards to the extent that their contact details are known. Otherwise, the correspondence is kept on file for eventual forwarding.We offer the subject of a fansite direct editorial influence over the site.  In the vast majority of cases, they are delighted to see a professional organization developing a fan site, all the while knowing that they have editorial influence (unlike Wikipedia, YouTube, etc).While there is no best way to clean up the web, I believe it is the responsibility of all domainers to do their part."
A new liquidity model for domains	13-Oct-09	"Earlier this week, Epik led the purchase ofHardDrives.com.  Epik had already developed the site and was familiar with the site’s statistics. The buyer is new to the business of buying domains but he got a fair outcome. The seller got a fast close.  Buyer and seller are both happy.We are now running a similar (exclusive) process for the domains PearlEarrings.com and FamilyVacation.com. These  are both excellent names with high development potential where the seller has decided not to develop them.What is notable here is the following:1. The buyer is not interested in owning a parked domain. He is interested in building a business. He is not a domain speculator.  This is notable because it has implications for domainers whose traditional buyer (other domainers) are either tapped out or holding out for lower prices.2. The seller significantly increased his chances of getting the domain sold by partnering with Epik as the  3rd party developer who could substantiate statistics about site traffic and monetization.3. The buyer got a running start at building a business. Epik brokered the transaction for a modest escrow fee in order to have the opportunity to continue to develop the name on the Epik platform.The recent lesson ofInsure.com’s blockbuster sale for $16 millionis also instructive. This was more than a domain. It was a website with a vast number of backlinks. In other words, development of the name reduced risk for the buyer, which in turn justifies a higher purchase price.These are challenging times for many domainers.  Innovation and cooperation are important ingredients for getting deals done, particularly when deals need to be done on short notice."
Domain Development – the real reasons why minisites are not the answer	19-Sep-09	"There has been increased public debate about the various approaches to domain development. As a category, Minisites in particular,took a drubbing this week.  Part of the problem here is self-inflicted. A quick search on Google for the term “minisites” reveals a litany of get rich quick schemes when in reality developing worthwhile and differentiated user experiences is actually hard work.I have been working full-time on domain development projects for the past 2 years. My first real exposure was the opportunity to work with theHealthcare.comteam as the Founding Chairman. A few months later, I had the opportunity to co-foundPatents.comandAlerts.com, as part of my role as investor and advisor toInternet Real Estate Group. Around the same time, in late 2007, I became the first outside investor in what is known today asDevHub.com. I was then, and remain today, a big believer in the idea of “domains as an asset class” and that domains are “the raw land of the internet” .In early 2009, I came to the conclusion that there was an opportunity to do domain development on a much larger scale.  This conclusion was partly informed by my ongoing interaction with a number of domainers who had significant portfolios and had either been unsuccessful in their own domain developments, or were reluctant to take the plunge because they lacked the requisite development skills. I also was astounded by the success ofDemand Mediain attracting vast amounts of institutional private equity with which to fund acquisitions and what Richard Rosenblatt refers to asMixology.With regards to minisites, my conclusion is that in the vast majority of cases the economics simply don’t work unless it is being done with the specific plan of taking a new site to the next level, and in the very near future.  It can be viewed as a kick-start while more comprehensive development is being completed. Unfortunately, most minisites are not produced within the context of a forward-looking vision for the site. So, instead of jump-starting a novel  web property, a domainer might spend $300-1000 to produce a site that will be irrelevant shortly after the day it is launched.One of the biggest differences in Epik’s approach is that we are focused on (1) creating an interconnected ecosystem, and (2) managing the resulting content using a platform-driven approach.By ecosystem, I am referring to the notion of mutual interdependence across a federated network of properties.  Indeed, the emergence of the semantic web is an enabler for this network, as is the emergence of portable identity. There is also a tremendous amount of content and intellectual property available for cost-effective licensing.  Yet with all this abundance, there is still a need for an intuitive navigation framework. Domains have an important role here.By platform-driven, I am referring to software that allows best practices to be systematically deployed across a plurality of sites. For example,Tanning.com,Karate.com,Park.com, andHaircare.comall share a common codebase. In the coming weeks we’ll release Hobbies.com, Clothing.com, Dive.com, and Bookstore.com, all using this unified architecture.  Moreover, by using a platform approach, we can cross-link these vertical directories to anetwork of local geo domainsthereby creating an intersection of vertical subject matter with local interest. We are building more platforms.So, my advice to domainers is not to bother with minisites. You will more than likely not recoup your investment. Instead, figure out ways to occupy what I call “chokepoints on the ecosystem”, which is to say to occupy nodes in the network so that as the network takes form, your domains are positioned for long-term relevance.  If you have notsubmitted your domainsto the Epik network, I encourage you to do so soon. Worst-case, you will get free content and free advice on how to add value to your undeveloped domains."
Epik acquires DNKO.com	20-Aug-09	"Epik is pleased to announce the acquisition of DNKO.com.DomainNameWire.comtold the story first, and well.This acquisition adds a key component to the platform for managing domains across the life-cycle, from acquisiton to sale.   We look forward to announcing exciting improvements to the Epik auction platform, with a notable emphasis of helping domains to become matched with the logical end-client developers of the domain versus the long history of domainer-to-domainer transactions.Dan Ramirez, Founder of DNKO.com, will continue to work with Epik in the capacity of development lead for the Epik Auction platform.  Dan is truly an undiscovered talent in the domain world. I look forward to seeing more of his work in the months and years ahead.To try out Epik’s auction platform visitauctions.epik.com."
Welcome to the Epik blog	19-Aug-09	"The time has come to to tell the Epik story.  August 19, 2009 marks the birthday of Epik’s blog.The idea of Epik has been under development for more than 2 years.  It was not a direct route. There have been wins along the way. We also had our share of false starts and dead ends.   Aong the way, we learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t work.  Epik is fundamentally about distilling what we believe works, and applying it across a network of direct navigation properties that converge great domain names, with great content, and intuitive user interfaces.Epik’s goal is simple. We aim to be the domainer’s best friend — helping domainers to cross over from a singular dependence on domain parking to a more diversified array of value creation strategies that unlock the potential associated with an intuitive domain name. After two years of learning and listening, we are more convinced than ever that opportunities for value creation abound.While there is no set master plan, we believe the internet will evolve in some ways that can be anticipated, even if the timing is unpredictable. Along the way, we will do our level best to be guided by principles:We aim to help build an internet that is truly better than the one we found.We will build, partner or acquire to assemble the best ideas, brightest minds, and most desirable assets.We will listen carefully to both our fans and our critics, recognizing that “the crowd” usually does get it right though indivduals often don’t.We will do our level best to be fair and transparent in our business practices seeking enduring win-win with our partner.Epik’s primary customers are the individuals and enterprises who control the vast majority of the world’s undeveloped domains.  We believe that the raw land of the internet is ultimately worth more when it can be integrated into an integrated network.  As much fun as the “wild west” days have been fun (and lucrative) for much of the last 17 years of domaining, it must eventually give way to a new paradigm.  As domainers, we can either embrace this transition, or have it foisted upon us. As I will discuss in future posts, Web 3.0 and the Semantic Web 3.0 are good news for domainers.Our approach to domain development can be best described as four distinct types:Parked domain – A domain submitted to Epik is automatically accepted into the Epik parking network.  It is our least-preferred option but it is a default option when no other immediate option exists. At Epik, “parking” is a temporary state, and still part of the network.Template site –  Epik is building a robust content management platform which allows undeveloped domains to be populated with useful content that maps semantically to the domain name.Platform site – Epik is partnering with platform partners to create high quality networks of sites based on platforms. Early platforms include (1) directory sites, (2) geography sites, and (3) workflow sites. More about these in future posts.Development ventures – Epik will  partner with domain owners to create entire businesses around a domain name, forming businesses with their own capital structures that can go on to attract outside capital, as well as acquire established companies.Thanks for reading.Rob MonsterAugust 19 2009Seattle, WA"
